## Trafficking is necessary to capture IL-2 and IL-15 dose response and the effect of IL-2Rα expression

![**Incorporating trafficking leads to an accurate model of IL-2 & IL-15 response.** Experimental data was collected in previously published studies [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @mitra_interleukin-2_2015] A) Schematic of all receptor (boxes)-ligand (circles) complexes and binding events. Active (pSTAT signaling; containing two non-α receptors) complexes are outlined in red. Rate constants obtained from literature, detailed balance, or fitting are denoted by diamonds, octagons, or octagons with a double outline, respectively. Rate constants that were experimentally measured relative to other rates are denoted by triangles. While we do not include the Jak-STAT pathway by which active signaling complexes phosphorylate STAT, we use a simple scalar factor to translate active signaling complex predictions to pSTAT predictions. Full model ODEs can be found in the methods section. B-E) Model fit to experimental results, represented by shaded regions and shapes respectively, for B) maximal pSTAT5 activation in YT-1 cells under various concentrations of ligand stimulation for 500 min, and C-E) the percent of initial IL-2Rβ (C, D) and γ~c~ (E) on the cell surface for various ligand stimulation concentrations and cell types. The 25-75% and 10-90% confidence intervals of the model's fit are shaded dark and light respectively. Due to low fit variability, only the 25-75% interval is visible. F-H) Posterior distributions after data fitting. Complex Formation Rate (k~fwd~) has units of $\mathrm{cell \times \#^{-1} \times min^{-1}}$, and Sorting Fraction (f~sort~) is unitless. I) Posterior distributions for the analogous association constants of IL-2 and IL-15. Association constants measured in literature are represented by dots. Association constants are shown for species in parentheses complexing with following species. K~a~s for (2)·2Rα, (15)·15Rα, (2)·2Rβ, and (15)·2Rβ have units of nM, all other K~a~s have units of $\mathrm{\# \times cell^{-1}}$.](./Manuscript/Figures/figure1.svg){#fig:modelConstruct}

To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a differential equation model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the γ~c~ receptor cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Binding interactions were modeled based on their known structural components, and led to the formation of receptor complexes capable of JAK/STAT signaling [@Rochman_2009]. Endocytic trafficking of cell surface receptors is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback [@Fallon2000; @Fallon10032000; @Basquin1099; @Volk21120]. Therefore, we extended earlier modeling efforts by including the trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into an endosomal compartment while continuing to produce JAK/STAT signaling and participate in binding events. Full model ODEs can be found in the methods section. 

Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by previous experimental measurements, detailed balance, or estimated by model fitting to existing experimental measurements ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B–E). Fitting was performed to measurements of STAT5 phosphorylation and surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~, upon either IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation, in either wild-type YT-1 human NK cells or YT-1 cells selected for expression of IL-2Rα. The experimental data was collected from previously published studies [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. The posterior parameter distributions from these fits ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F–I) were plugged back into our model and showed quantitative agreement with the data, including differential sensitivity with IL-2Rα expression ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B–F) [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. To evaluate the effect of including trafficking, we fit a version of the model without trafficking to the pSTAT5 measurements, using the same cell population as before; the model failed to fully capture differences with IL-2Rα expression even when using this limited fitting data ([@Fig:supp1]). Within the posterior distribution of parameter fits, IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model (k~4~ < k~16~ & k~11~ < k~23~), consistent with prior work ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. However, the opposite was inferred for IL-2Rβ (k~4~ > k~16~) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ (k~11~ = k~23~) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ occurs through rapid endocytosis of active complexes and indeed, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-E). Correspondingly, active complex internalization (k~endo,a~) was inferred to be ~10x greater than that for inactive species (k~endo~) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). These data indicated that accounting for trafficking is essential for modeling IL-2 and IL-15 signaling response.

Since IL-2 and IL-15 drive the formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their inferred binding rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I). The two ligands had nearly the same direct binding affinity to IL-2Rβ; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity than IL-2 for its α-chain. Consequently, IL-15’s complexes were inferred to more readily dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes (k~8~ > k~20~, k~12~ > k~24~). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts (k~9~ < k~21~, k~10~ < k~22~, k~11~ < k~23~). The affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand·IL-2Rβ and ligand·α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 (k~4~ = k~16~, k~5~ = k~17~). The data is also consistent with the literature in that both ligands have a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ when they are bound to their α-chain (k~2~, k~14~ > k~11~, k~23~) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. In total, a model of IL-2 and IL-15 incorporating trafficking is consistent with known biophysical and cell response measurements.

## Family model correctly captures IL-4/IL-7 dose responses and cross-inhibition

![**A reaction model captures cytokine-cytokine interactions.** Experimental data was collected in previously published studies [@Gonnordeaal1253]. A) Schematic of IL-4 and IL-7 receptor complexes competing for γ~c~ and generating distinct pSTAT signals. B-C) Fitting model to experimental data. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles. Shaded areas represent the 25-75% and 10-90% confidence intervals of the model's fit. pSTAT5 and pSTAT6 were measured for IL-7 and IL-4 experiments, respectively. B) Single-cytokine pSTAT dose-response measurements for 10 min of exposure to IL-4 and IL-7. Experiment was performed in duplicate (N = 2). C) Percent inhibition of the second cytokine's pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment. Human PBMC-derived T cells (CD4^+^TCR^+^CCR7^high^) were pretreated with various concentrations of one cytokine for 10 min before being stimulated with a fixed concentration (2 pM IL-7 or 6.25 pM IL-4) of the other cytokine for an additional 10 min. D) Model's fit for percent inhibition of the second cytokine's pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment with the assumption that active species are endocytosed at the same rate as inactive species. C,D) Experiments were performed in triplicate (N = 3). E) Model predictions for percent of γ~c~ on the cell surface when exposed to 100 pg/mL of either IL-7 or IL-4 for 100 min. F) Violin plot of K~a~ values obtained via posterior distributions of complex formation rates / reverse binding rates for k~rev~ parameters corresponding to different complexes competing for the common γ~c~ (Fig.\ref{fig:modelConstruct}A).

To further test our model incorporating trafficking, we evaluated its performance in a series of experiments involving IL-4 and IL-7. IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors and so the signaling activity of each cytokine cannot be distinguished. IL-4 and IL-7 activity, in contrast, can be distinguished when both cytokines are co-administered to cells by measuring STAT6 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Using this phenomenon we explored previously published cross-inhibition data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMC-derived T cells (CD4^+^TCR^+^CCR7^high^) both individually and together [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Using surface abundance measurements of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~, we applied a steady-state assumption in the absence of ligand to solve for each receptor expression rate [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Our model fits both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B–C). The fitting process identifiably constrained reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and pSTAT scaling constants ([@Fig:cytokInt]F–I). While surface abundance was constrained, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]G–I).

The experimental data and model fits showed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than vice versa ([@Fig:cytokInt]C) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Consistent with the experimentally-derived mechanism [@Gonnordeaal1253], this inhibitory behavior was explained by the competition of ligand·α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The inferred K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 (k~27~) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 (k~33~), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model showed that the same inhibitory relationships hold in the case where active complexes internalize at the same rate as other species ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). Internalization was additionally dismissed because the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface after ligand stimulation in both model simulation and experimental measurement ([@Fig:cytokInt]E) [@Gonnordeaal1253].
