To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a reaction model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the common γ~c~ cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Endocytic trafficking of cell surfacen receptors is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback [@Fallon2000; @Fallon10032000; @Basquin1099]. Therefore, we extended earlier modeling efforts by including trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into a distinct endocytic compartment continue to produce STAT5 signaling and participate in binding events.

Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by previous experimental measurements, detailed balance, or estimated by model fitting to existing experimental measurements ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-E, Table 1). Fitting was performed to measurements of STAT5 phosphorylation and surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~. The posterior parameter distributions from these fits ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F-I) were plugged back into our model and showed quantitative agreement with the data ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-E) [@ring_mechanistic_2012; mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. To evaluate the effect of including trafficking, we fit a version of the model without trafficking to the pSTAT5 measurements; the model failed to capture differences with IL-2Rα expression even when using this limited fitting data ([@Fig:supp1]). IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model ($k_{4} < k_{16}$ & $k_{11} < k_{23}$), consistent with prior work ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. However, the opposite was true for IL-2Rβ ($k_{4} > k_{16}$) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ ($k_{11} = k_{23}$) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ occurs through rapid endocytosis of active complexes and indeed, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-D). Correspondingly, active complex internalization ($k_{endo,a}$) was inferred to be ~10x greater than that for inactive species ($k_{endo}$) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). These data indicated that accounting for trafficking is essential for modeling IL-2 and IL-15 signaling response.

Our model produced specific predictions about the abundance of each receptor within YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). To validate these, we experimentally quantified the absolute receptor abundance for YT-1 cells. [TODO: add sentence about how accurate this winds up being].

Since IL-2 and IL-15 lead to formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their inferred binding rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). The two ligands had nearly the same direct binding affinity to IL-2Rβ; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity than IL-2 for its α-chain. Consequently, IL-15’s complexes were inferred to more readily dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes ($k_{8} > k_{20}$, $k_{12} > k_{24}$). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts ($k_{9} < k_{21}$, $k_{10} < k_{22}$, $k_{11} < k_{23}$). The affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand·IL-2Rβ and ligand·α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 ($k_{4} = k_{16}$, $k_{5} = k_{17}$). The data is also consistent with literature in that both ligands have higher affinity for IL-2Rβ when they are bound to their α-chain ($k_{2}, k_{14} > k_{11}, k_{23}$) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. In total, a model of IL-2 and IL-15 incorporating trafficking is consistent with known biophysical and cell response measurements.

## Family model correctly captures both single and combination IL-4/IL-7 dose response

To further test our model incorporating trafficking, we evaluated its performance in a series of experiments involving IL-4 and IL-7. IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors and so the signaling activity of each cytokine cannot be distinguished. IL-4 and IL-7 activity, in contrast, can be distinguished when both cytokines are co-administered to cells since by measuring STAT6 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Using this phenomenon we explored cross-inhibition data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMCs both individually and together [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Using surface abundance measurements of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~, we applied a steady state assumption in the absence of autocrine ligand to solve for each receptor expression rates. Our model fit both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B-C). The fitting process identifiably constrained reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and pSTAT scaling constants ([@Fig:cytokInt]F-I). Despite fixed initial surface abundance, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]G-H).

The experimental data and model predictions revealed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than IL-4 inhibited IL-7 activity ([@Fig:cytokInt]C) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Such inhibitory behavior was explained by the competition of ligand + α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 ($k_{27}$) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 ($k_{33}$), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that the same inhibitory relationships hold when active complexes internalize at the same rate as other species ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). Additionally, the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface after ligand stimulation ([@Fig:cytokInt]E), as observed experimentally [@Gonnordeaal1253].

## Tensor Factorization Maps Response-Space of the Gamma Chain Family

One challenge when exploring the function of large receptor families such as the common gamma chain cytokines is their pleiotropy across cell populations. Even with a model that can predict signaling response to a specific concentration of ligand, exploring ligand response across the many responding cell types requires tracking the response of each population individually. Therefore, we sought to apply factorization as a means to visualizing the ligand response across many different cell populations.

To evaluate how different immune cell populations might respond to the gamma chain cytokines, we quantitatively profiled the receptor expression of 11 cell types.

Upon fitting the model to experimental measurements and obtaining the unknown parameters, we ran simulations on 13 cell types and monitored the interleukin activity with time. This presented a three-dimensional (time, cell type, ligand) tensor which we then decomposed with non-negative CP decomposition (Fig. 3A). Cell types were defined by the quantity of each receptor subspecies on their surfaces. We therefore experimentally quantified receptor levels on 13 cell types for IL-2Rα,  IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and IL-15Rα (Fig. 3B). In our simulations, each cell was treated with a single interleukin over a range of concentrations ($10^{-2}$ to $10$ nM). This allowed us to build a tensor dataset for the following ligands: wild type IL-2, mutant IL-2, and wild type IL-15. The mutant IL-2 ligand was known to have a 10x enriched affinity for IL-2Rα compared to wild type IL-2 ($10 * k_{1,mut} = k_{1,wt}$). After constructing the tensor with these simulations, we iteratively decomposed the tensor while varying the number of components to determine the minimum number of components needed to obtain a percent explained variance ($\mathrm{R^{2}X}$) above 90%. The $\mathrm{R^{2}X}$ value increased as we increased the number of components and we reached the 90% threshold with three components since a three component decomposition had a $\mathrm{R^{2}X}$ of 93.1% (Fig. 3C). However, we decomposed our tensor to four components for visualization purposes. Note that four components will present overlapping information along the factorization matrices as the R2X reached 95%. To show the relationships among the three dimensions of the tensor, the component values of each dimension were plotted against each other, and the dimensions were placed side by side. The tensor’s first dimension was time, second was cell type, and third was ligands. For component 1 of the decomposition, IL-15 was most pronounced with the other ligands essentially at zero (Fig. 3F). High concentrations of IL-15 elicited a stronger activity response in naive and memory cytotoxic T cells since they all had a high component 1 score (Fig. 3E). This result aligns well with previous findings that suggest IL-15 induced proliferation for these cells and increased their turnover in vivo [@Berard5018]. Moreover, NKT also scored high on component, corresponding to high IL-15 concentrations. This relationship does not come as a surprise given that IL-15 is knows to regulate NKT maturation and survival [@Gordy6335]. These cells were also characterized by lower IL-15Rα surface receptor levels (Fig. 3B). Similarly, as IL-15’s concentration increased, its weight influence was more evident on cells higher along component one (Fig. 3E) that had higher IL-15Rα surface receptor levels (Fig. 3B). IL-15’s activity increased to a maximum during the first 25 minutes of a 4-hour simulation experiment, and then decreased to plateau at 50 minutes (Fig. 3D). Though redundant, component three also emphasized IL-15 activity, and the cell alignment and temporal behavior was similar to that of component two (Figs. 3D, G, H). 

Both the wild type and mutant IL-2 were most heavily weighted along the second component of the tensor decomposition (Fig. 3F). Cells that were more responsive to higher IL-2 doses had higher values along component two (Fig. 3E) as well as higher surface IL-2Rα levels (Fig. 3B). For example, T regulatory (including memory and naive), NK, and T helper cells all scored high along component two. This directly affirms previous literature suggesting that regulatory T cells are highly responsive to IL-2 induced activity [@chinen2016]. Furthermore, IL-2 has been shown to activate T helper cells as well as induce a positive feedback loop for the IL-2 signaling pathway [Busse3058]. In addition, high affinity mutant IL-2 have been previously shown to potently stimulate T cell growth [@Rao]. On the lower end, cells with lower IL-2Rα receptor counts exhibited lower activity such as naive and memory cytotoxic T cells (Fig. 3E). These results confirm previous understanding about Naive T cell’s relative insensitivity to IL-2 due to their low surface IL-2Rβ and γ~c~receptor levels [@Levin2012]. For component two, an oscillatory activity response was observed the first 25 minutes of the experiment, but then continued to decrease afterwards (Fig. 3D). The mutant version of the IL-2 diverged from the wild type behavior on component four. On the ligand decomposition plot, the mutant IL-2 had a much higher score along this component than wild type IL-2 (Fig 3H). The cells that corresponded to it include T regulatory cells along with memory and naive T regulatory cells (Fig. 3G), which were all characterized by levels of IL-2Rα and γ~c~ receptors that were around 20 times higher than IL-15Rα and IL-2Rβ (Fig. 3B). The temporal behavior for this mutant IL-2 along component four reached a maximum activity around 25 minutes after which it decreased slowly (Fig. 3D). This divergence from the wild type IL-2 allows for comparison on how it targets cell populations differently. Other tensor decomposition methods can also be applied to this tensor. For example, we performed a non-negative Tucker decomposition and showed similar plots in Figure S4.

## Tensor Factorization Shows Experimental Results
Given that this generated tensor was obtained through running simulations, we showed that the decomposition techniques can also be applied to experimental measurements. We collected ligand activity data for cells treated with either wild type IL-2 or IL-15 in a similar setup and constructed a tensor. Non-negative CP decomposition was performed on this experimental tensor, and similar cell, time, and ligand decomposition plots are shown in Figure S5.
