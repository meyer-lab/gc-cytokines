To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a reaction model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the common γ~c~ cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). As endocytic trafficking is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback for surface receptors and their ligands, we extended earlier efforts by including trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into a distinct endocytic compartment where they could continue to produce STAT5 signaling and participate in binding events. Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by direct experimental measurement (diamond), soluble experimental measurement (triangle), detailed balance (octagon), or estimated by fitting model (double outlined octagon) to existing experimental measurements of pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D) [@ring_mechanistic_2012].

A novel feature of our model was that it accounted for endosomal trafficking and signaling. Trafficking was deemed an integral part of our model since rapid IL-2Rβ internalization following stimulation with either IL-2 or IL-15 was measured experimentally [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. The trafficking version of the model was fit to both pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ measurements; the posterior parameter distributions taken from these fits were plugged back into our model and accurately fit the data ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D). The no-trafficking version of the model was fit to only the pSTAT5 measurements and consequently the posterior parameter distributions were more broadly defined than in the trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]). Both the trafficking and no-trafficking models had Geweke scores that oscillated between -1 and 1, indicating that both models converged during MCMC sampling ([@Fig:supp2]) [@Geweke92]. Additionally, IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model ($k_{4} < k_{16}$ and $k_{11} < k_{23}$); however, the opposite was true for IL-2Rβ ($k_{4} > k_{16}$) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ ($k_{11} = k_{23}$) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:modelConstruct]E, [@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ occurs when YT-1 cells were given both IL-2 and IL-15 as both ligands could form active complexes with IL-2Rβ. Consistent with surface receptor depletion driven through rapid active complex internalization, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-D). Correspondingly, the rate of active complex internalization ($k_{endo,a}$) was ~10x greater than that for inactive species ($k_{endo}$) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). In addition to capturing individual dose responses, the model accurately represented the effect of changes in IL-2Rα expression. The experimental pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ data for both IL2-Rα-negative and -expressing YT-1 cells was fit by setting the IL-2Rα expression rate to 0 in the former case and letting the rate vary by the fit parameter in the latter case.

Our model produced specific predictions about the abundance of each receptor within YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). To validate these, we experimentally quantified the absolute receptor abundance for YT-1 cells. [add sentence about how accurate this winds up being].

Since IL-2 and IL-15 lead to formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their reaction rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 therapies differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]E). The reaction rate for forward dimerization ($k_{fwd}$) was estimated to be 0.0031015611 ± 0.0005404771 $\mathrm{\frac{1/min}{num/cell}}$. The two ligands had nearly the same affinity for binding directly to IL-2Rβ and neither ligand binds directly to γ~c~; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity for its α-chain than IL-2 did for its α-chain. We inferred that IL-15’s complexes were much more likely to dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes ($k_{12} >> k_{24}$ and $k_{8} >> k_{20}$). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts ($k_{9} > k_{21}$, $k_{10} > k_{22}$, and $k_{11} > k_{23}$). However, the affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand + IL-2Rβ and ligand + α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 ($k_{4} = k_{16}$ and $k_{5} = k_{17}$).


## Family model correctly captures both single and combination IL-4/IL-7 dose response

I) Model predictions for percent inhibition of the second cytokine’s pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment with the assumption that active species are endocytosed at the same rate as inactive species ($k_{endo,a} = 0$).](./Figures/figure2.svg){#fig:cytokInt}

While the active complexes of IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors, preventing the activity contributions of each cytokine from being distinguished from one another, IL-4 and IL-7 activity can be distinguished when both cytokines were co-administered to cells since IL-4 and IL-7 produce pSTAT6 and pSTAT5 signaling, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Due to this phenomenon we fit data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMCs both independently and in combination [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Unlike our data for IL-2 and IL-15 in YT-1 cells, the data for IL-4 and IL-7 in human PBMCs was accompanied by measurements of number of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~ receptors per cell. We used a steady state assumption in the absence of autocrine ligand to solve for  receptor expression rates. We fit our model to both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B-C). The fitting process allowed for reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and scaling constants to vary in order to fit the data ([@Fig:cytokInt]D-G). Even though receptor per cell measurements were fixed, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions since they are dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The forward rate of complexes dimerizing to any free receptor ($k_{fwd}$) was estimated to be 0.0536271143 ± 0.0139123847 $\mathrm{\frac{1/min}{num/cell}}$.

The experimental data and model predictions revealed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than IL-4 inhibited IL-7 activity ([@Fig:cytokInt]C). Such inhibition behavior was explained by the competition of ligand + α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 ($k_{27}$) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 ($k_{33}$), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface when cells were stimulated with 100 pg/mL of either IL-4 or IL-7 for 100 minutes ([@Fig:cytokInt]H).

## Tensor Factorization Maps Response-Space of the Gamma Chain Family
Upon fitting the model to experimental measurements and obtaining the unknown parameters, we ran simulations on 13 cell types and monitored the interleukin activity with time. This presented a three-dimensional (time, cell type, ligand) tensor upon which the non-negative form of CP decomposition was performed (Fig. 3A). In the model, cell types were defined by the quantity of each receptor subspecies on their surfaces. From our experiments, we quantified receptor levels on 13 cell types for IL-2Rα,  IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and IL-15Rα (Fig. 3B). Each cell was treated with one interleukin at a time each spanning a range of concentrations ($10^{-2}$ to 10 nM). This allowed us to build a dataset tensor for the following ligands: IL-2 wild type, IL-2 mutant, and IL-15 wild type. The IL-2 ligand mutant was defined as the IL-2Rα affinity-enriched IL2 whose k1-reverse rate was 10% of that of wild type IL-2. After developing the tensor, we performed the decomposition several times to determine the minimum number of components needed to obtain a percent explained variance (R2X) of over 90%. As the number of components increased, the R2X increased as well (Fig. 3C). Results show that decomposing to three components reached this limit first with an R2X of 93.1%, but we decomposed our tensor to four components for visualization purposes. Note that four components will present overlapping information along the factorization matrices as the R2X reached 95%. To show the relationships among the three dimensions of the tensor, the component values of each dimension were plotted against each other, and the dimensions were placed side by side. The tensor’s first dimension represented time, second was cell types, and the third portrayed the ligands. For component one of the decomposition, IL-15 was most pronounced with the other ligands essentially at zero (Fig. 3F). High concentrations of IL-15 elicited a stronger activity response in naive and memory cytotoxic T cells since they all had a high component one score(Fig. 3E). This result aligns well with previous findings that suggest IL-15 induced proliferation for these cells and increased their turnover in vivo[@Berard5018]. Moreover, NKT also scored high on component, corresponding to high IL-15 concentrations. This relationship does not come as a surprise given that IL-15 is knows to regulate NKT muaturation and survival[@Gordy6335].  These cells were also characterized by lower IL-15Rα surface receptor levels (Fig. 3B). Similarly, as IL-15’s concentration increased, its weight influence was more evident on cells higher along component one (Fig. 3E) that had higher IL-15Rα surface receptor levels (Fig. 3B). IL-15’s activity increased to a maximum during the first 25 minutes of a 4-hour simulation experiment, and then decreased to plateau at 50 minutes (Fig. 3D). Though redundant, component three also emphasized IL-15 activity, and the cell alignment and temporal behavior was similar to that of component two (Figs. 3D, G, H). 

Both the wild type and mutant IL-2 were most heavily weighted along the second component of the tensor decomposition (Fig. 3F). Cells that were more responsive to higher IL-2 doses had higher values along component two (Fig. 3E) as well as higher surface IL-2Rα levels (Fig. 3B). For example, T regulatory (including memory and naive), NK, and T helper cells all scored high along component two. This directly affirms previous literature suggesting that regulatory T cells are highly responsive to IL-2 induced activity [@chinen2016]. Furthermore, IL-2 has been shown to activate T helper cells as well as induce a positive feedback loop for the IL-2 signaling pathway [Busse3058]. In addition, high affinity mutant IL-2 have been previously shown to potently stimulate T cell growth [@Rao]. On the lower end, cells with lower IL-2Rα receptor counts exhibited lower activity such as naive and memory cytotoxic T cells (Fig. 3E). These results confirm previous understanding about Naive T cell’s relative insensitivity to IL-2 due to their low surface IL-2Rβ and γ~c~receptor levels [@Levin2012]. For component two, an oscillatory activity response was observed the first 25 minutes of the experiment, but then continued to decrease afterwards (Fig. 3D). The mutant version of the IL-2 diverged from the wild type behavior on component four. On the ligand decomposition plot, the mutant IL-2 had a much higher score along this component than wild type IL-2 (Fig 3H). The cells that corresponded to it include T regulatory cells along with memory and naive T regulatory cells (Fig. 3G), which were all characterized by levels of IL-2Rα and γ~c~ receptors that were around 20 times higher than IL-15Rα and IL-2Rβ (Fig. 3B). The temporal behavior for this mutant IL-2 along component four reached a maximum activity around 25 minutes after which it decreased slowly (Fig. 3D). This divergence from the wild type IL-2 allows for comparison on how it targets cell populations differently. Other tensor decomposition methods can also be applied to this tensor. For example, we performed a non-negative Tucker decomposition and showed similar plots in Figure S4.

## Tensor Factorization Shows Experimental Results
Given that this generated tensor was obtained through running simulations, we showed that the decomposition techniques can also be applied to experimental measurements. We collected ligand activity data for cells treated with either wild type IL-2 or IL-15 in a similar setup and constructed a tensor. Non-negative CP decomposition was performed on this experimental tensor, and similar cell, time, and ligand decomposition plots are shown in Figure S5.
