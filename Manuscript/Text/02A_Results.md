To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a differential equation model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the γ~c~ receptor cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Binding interactions were modeled based on their known structural components, and led to the formation of receptor complexes capable of JAK/STAT signaling [@Rochman_2009]. Endocytic trafficking of cell surface receptors is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback [@Fallon2000; @Fallon10032000; @Basquin1099; @Volk21120]. Therefore, we extended earlier modeling efforts by including the trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into an endosomal compartment while continuing to produce JAK/STAT signaling and participate in binding events.

Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by previous experimental measurements, detailed balance, or estimated by model fitting to existing experimental measurements ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B–E). Fitting was performed to measurements of STAT5 phosphorylation and surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~, upon either IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation, in either wild-type YT-1 human NK cells or YT-1 cells selected for expression of IL-2Rα. The posterior parameter distributions from these fits ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F–I) were plugged back into our model and showed quantitative agreement with the data, including differential sensitivity with IL-2Rα expression ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B–F) [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. To evaluate the effect of including trafficking, we fit a version of the model without trafficking to the pSTAT5 measurements, using the same cell population as before; the model failed to fully capture differences with IL-2Rα expression even when using this limited fitting data ([@Fig:supp1]). Within the posterior distribution of parameter fits, IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model (k~4~ < k~16~ & k~11~ < k~23~), consistent with prior work ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. However, the opposite was inferred for IL-2Rβ (k~4~ > k~16~) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ (k~11~ = k~23~) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ occurs through rapid endocytosis of active complexes and indeed, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-E). Correspondingly, active complex internalization (k~endo,a~) was inferred to be ~10x greater than that for inactive species (k~endo~) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). These data indicated that accounting for trafficking is essential for modeling IL-2 and IL-15 signaling response.

Since IL-2 and IL-15 drive the formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their inferred binding rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I). The two ligands had nearly the same direct binding affinity to IL-2Rβ; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity than IL-2 for its α-chain. Consequently, IL-15’s complexes were inferred to more readily dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes (k~8~ > k~20~, k~12~ > k~24~). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts (k~9~ < k~21~, k~10~ < k~22~, k~11~ < k~23~). The affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand·IL-2Rβ and ligand·α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 (k~4~ = k~16~, k~5~ = k~17~). The data is also consistent with the literature in that both ligands have a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ when they are bound to their α-chain (k~2~, k~14~ > k~11~, k~23~) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. In total, a model of IL-2 and IL-15 incorporating trafficking is consistent with known biophysical and cell response measurements.

## Family model correctly captures IL-4/IL-7 dose responses and cross-inhibition

B-C) Fitting model to experimental data. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles. Shaded areas represent the 25-75% and 10-90% confidence intervals of model predictions. pSTAT5 and pSTAT6 were measured for IL-7 and IL-4 experiments, respectively. B) Single-cytokine pSTAT dose-response measurements for 10 min of exposure to IL-4 and IL-7. C) Percent inhibition of the second cytokine's pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment. Human PBMC-derived T cells (CD4^+^TCR^+^CCR7^high^) were pretreated with various concentrations of one cytokine for 10 min before being stimulated with a fixed concentration (2 pM IL-7 or 6.25 pM IL-4) of the other cytokine for an additional 10 min. D) Model predictions for percent inhibition of the second cytokine's pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment with the assumption that active species are endocytosed at the same rate as inactive species (k~endo,a~ = k~endo~). E) Model predictions for percent of γ~c~ on the cell surface when exposed to 100 pg/mL of either IL-7 or IL-4 for 100 min.

To further test our model incorporating trafficking, we evaluated its performance in a series of experiments involving IL-4 and IL-7. IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors and so the signaling activity of each cytokine cannot be distinguished. IL-4 and IL-7 activity, in contrast, can be distinguished when both cytokines are co-administered to cells by measuring STAT6 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Using this phenomenon we explored cross-inhibition data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMC-derived T cells (CD4^+^TCR^+^CCR7^high^) both individually and together [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Using surface abundance measurements of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~, we applied a steady-state assumption in the absence of ligand to solve for each receptor expression rate [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Our model fits both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B–C). The fitting process identifiably constrained reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and pSTAT scaling constants ([@Fig:cytokInt]F–I). While surface abundance was constrained, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]G–I).

The experimental data and model fits showed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than vice versa ([@Fig:cytokInt]C) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Consistent with the experimentally-derived mechanism [@Gonnordeaal1253], this inhibitory behavior was explained by the competition of ligand·α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The inferred K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 (k~27~) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 (k~33~), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that the same inhibitory relationships hold when active complexes internalize at the same rate as other species ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). Internalization was additionally dismissed because the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface after ligand stimulation in both model simulation and experimental measurement ([@Fig:cytokInt]E) [@Gonnordeaal1253].
