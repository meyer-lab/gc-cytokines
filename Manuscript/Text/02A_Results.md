To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a reaction model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the common γ~c~ cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Endocytic trafficking of cell surface receptors is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback [@Fallon2000; @Fallon10032000; @Basquin1099]. Therefore, we extended earlier modeling efforts by including trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into an endosomal compartment and continued to produce STAT5 signaling and participate in binding events.

Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by previous experimental measurements, detailed balance, or estimated by model fitting to existing experimental measurements ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-E, Table 1). Fitting was performed to measurements of STAT5 phosphorylation and surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~. The posterior parameter distributions from these fits ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F-I) were plugged back into our model and showed quantitative agreement with the data ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-F) [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. To evaluate the effect of including trafficking, we fit a version of the model without trafficking to the pSTAT5 measurements; the model failed to capture differences with IL-2Rα expression even when using this limited fitting data ([@Fig:supp1]). IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model ($k_{4} < k_{16}$ & $k_{11} < k_{23}$), consistent with prior work ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. However, the opposite was true for IL-2Rβ ($k_{4} > k_{16}$) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ ($k_{11} = k_{23}$) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ occurs through rapid endocytosis of active complexes and indeed, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-E). Correspondingly, active complex internalization ($k_{endo,a}$) was inferred to be ~10x greater than that for inactive species ($k_{endo}$) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). These data indicated that accounting for trafficking is essential for modeling IL-2 and IL-15 signaling response.

Our model produced specific predictions about the abundance of each receptor within YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). To validate these, we experimentally quantified the absolute receptor abundance for YT-1 cells. [TODO: add sentence about how accurate this winds up being].

Since IL-2 and IL-15 lead to formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their inferred binding rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I). The two ligands had nearly the same direct binding affinity to IL-2Rβ; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity than IL-2 for its α-chain. Consequently, IL-15’s complexes were inferred to more readily dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes ($k_{8} > k_{20}$, $k_{12} > k_{24}$). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts ($k_{9} < k_{21}$, $k_{10} < k_{22}$, $k_{11} < k_{23}$). The affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand·IL-2Rβ and ligand·α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 ($k_{4} = k_{16}$, $k_{5} = k_{17}$). The data is also consistent with literature in that both ligands have higher affinity for IL-2Rβ when they are bound to their α-chain ($k_{2}, k_{14} > k_{11}, k_{23}$) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. In total, a model of IL-2 and IL-15 incorporating trafficking is consistent with known biophysical and cell response measurements.

## Family model correctly captures both single and combination IL-4/IL-7 dose response

B-C) Fitting model to experimental data. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles. Shaded areas represent the 25-75% and 10-90% confidence intervals of model predictions. pSTAT5 and pSTAT6 were measured for IL-7 and IL-4 experiments, respectively. B) Single-cytokine pSTAT dose-response measurements for 10 min of exposure to IL-4 and IL-7. C) Percent inhibition of the second cytokine’s pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment. Human PBMCs were pretreated with various concentrations of one cytokine for 10 min before being stimulated with a fixed concentration (50 pg/mL IL-7 or 100 pg/mL IL-4) of the other cytokine for an additional 10 min. D) Model predictions for percent inhibition of the second cytokine’s pSTAT response in a dual-cytokine dose-response experiment with the assumption that active species are endocytosed at the same rate as inactive species ($k_{endo,a} = 0$). E) Model predictions for percent of γ~c~ on the human PBMC surface when exposed to 100 pg/mL of either IL-7 or IL-4 for 100 min. F) Violin plot of K~a~ values obtained via posterior distributions of $\frac{k_{fwd}}{k_{rev}}$ for $k_{rev}$ parameters corresponding to different complexes competing for the common γ~c~ ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). G-I) Posterior distributions from fitting to data. $C_{5}$ and $C_{6}$ have units of $\mathrm{\# * cell^{-1}}$, $k_{fwd}$ has units of $\mathrm{cell * \#^{-1} * min^{-1}}$, and $f_{sort}$ is unitless](./Figures/figure2.svg){#fig:cytokInt}

To further test our model incorporating trafficking, we evaluated its performance in a series of experiments involving IL-4 and IL-7. IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors and so the signaling activity of each cytokine cannot be distinguished. IL-4 and IL-7 activity, in contrast, can be distinguished when both cytokines are co-administered to cells since by measuring STAT6 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Using this phenomenon we explored cross-inhibition data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMCs both individually and together [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Using surface abundance measurements of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~, we applied a steady state assumption in the absence of autocrine ligand to solve for each receptor expression rates. Our model fit both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B-C). The fitting process identifiably constrained reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and pSTAT scaling constants ([@Fig:cytokInt]F-I). Despite fixed initial surface abundance, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]G-I).

The experimental data and model predictions revealed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than IL-4 inhibited IL-7 activity ([@Fig:cytokInt]C) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Such inhibitory behavior was explained by the competition of ligand·α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 ($k_{27}$) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 ($k_{33}$), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that the same inhibitory relationships hold when active complexes internalize at the same rate as other species ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). Internalization was additionally dismissed because the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface after ligand stimulation in both model simulation and experimentation ([@Fig:cytokInt]E) [@Gonnordeaal1253].
