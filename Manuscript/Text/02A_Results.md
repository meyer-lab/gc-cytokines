To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a reaction model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the common γ~c~ cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). As endocytic trafficking is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback for surface receptors and their ligands, we extended earlier efforts by including trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into a distinct endocytic compartment where they could continue to produce STAT5 signaling and participate in binding events. Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by direct experimental measurement (diamond), soluble experimental measurement (triangle), detailed balance (octagon), or estimated by fitting model (double outlined octagon) to existing experimental measurements of pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A-D) [@ring_mechanistic_2012].

Trafficking was necessary to fit our IL-2 and IL-15 dose response data since versions of our model with no trafficking did not accurately predict pSTAT5 activity in YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]E). Trafficking was also deemed an integral part of our model since IL-2Rβ was rapidly internalized following stimulation with either IL-2 or IL-15 [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. The trafficking version of the model was fit to both pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ measurements; the posterior parameter distributions taken from these fits were plugged back into our model and accurately fit the data ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ occurs when YT-1 cells were given both IL-2 and IL-15 as both ligands could form active complexes with IL-2Rβ. Consistent with surface receptor depletion driven through rapid active complex internalization, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-D). Correspondingly, the rate of active complex internalization ($activeEndo$) was ~10x greater than that for inactive species ($endo$) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). In addition to capturing individual dose responses, the model accurately represented the effect of changes in IL-2Rα expression. The experimental pSTAT5 and surface IL-2Rβ data for both IL2-Rα-negative and -expressing YT-1 cells was fit by setting the IL-2Rα expression rate to 0 in the former case and letting the rate vary by the fit parameter in the latter case.

Our model produced specific predictions about the abundance of each receptor within YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]H). To validate these, we experimentally quantified the absolute receptor abundance for YT-1 cells. [add sentence about how accurate this winds up being]. After validation of receptor expression levels, we plugged in the known values and re-fit our model to experimental measurements. The results of this fitting process can be seen in Supplemental Figure #?.

Since IL-2 and IL-15 lead to formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their reaction rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 therapies differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]I). The two ligands had nearly the same affinity for binding directly to IL-2Rβ and neither ligand binds directly to γ~c~; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity for its α-chain than IL-2 did for its α-chain. We inferred that IL-15’s complexes were much more likely to dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes ($k12 >> k24$ and $k8 >> k20$). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts ($k9 > k21$, $k10 > k22$, and $k11 > k23$). However, the affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand + IL-2Rβ and ligand + α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 ($k4 = k16$ and $k5 = k17$).

## Family model correctly captures both single and combination IL-4/IL-7 dose response

While the active complexes of IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors, preventing the activity contributions of each cytokine from being distinguished from one another, IL-4 and IL-7 activity can be distinguished when both cytokines were co-administered to cells as IL-4 and IL-7 produce pSTAT6 and pSTAT5 signaling, respectively [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Due to this phenomenon we fit data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMCs both independently and in combination [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Unlike our data for IL-2 and IL-15 in YT-1 cells, the data for IL-4 and IL-7 in human PBMCs was accompanied by measurements of number of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~ receptors per cell. We used a steady state assumption in the absence of autocrine ligand to solve for  receptor expression rates. Despite having measurements of receptor expression, we needed to further constrain our model since only two trials were performed for each experiment and no data gave insight into the trafficking parameters. Therefore, we assumed that the trafficking parameters and $k_{fwd}$ seen in YT-1 cells were the same as in human PBMCs. These assumptions were why certain parameters were represented as flat lines ([@Fig:cytokInt]E-G). Once these constraints were made, we fit our model to both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B-C).

The experimental data and model predictions revealed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than IL-4 inhibited IL-7 activity ([@Fig:cytokInt]B). Such inhibition behavior was explained by the competition of ligand + α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The K~D~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 ($k27$) was smaller than the K~D~ for IL-4 ($k33$), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7_IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4_IL-4Rα to γ~c~ [@Fig:cytokInt]E. The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that more than 90% of the γ~c~ remained on the cell surface when cells were stimulated with 100 pg/mL of either IL-4 or IL-7 for 100 minutes [@Fig:cytokInt]D.
