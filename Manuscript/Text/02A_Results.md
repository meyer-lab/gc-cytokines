To model how individual binding events give rise to cell response, we built a reaction model representing the relevant binding and regulatory mechanisms within the common γ~c~ cytokine family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Endocytic trafficking of cell surfacen receptors is a critical mechanism of regulatory feedback [@Fallon2000; @Fallon10032000; @Basquin1099]. Therefore, we extended earlier modeling efforts by including trafficking of receptors and their complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Feinerman437]. We assumed that species trafficked into a distinct endocytic compartment continue to produce STAT5 signaling and participate in binding events.

Rate parameters for IL-2 and IL-15 binding events were parameterized by previous experimental measurements, detailed balance, or estimated by model fitting to existing experimental measurements ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-E, Table 1). Fitting was performed to measurements of STAT5 phosphorylation and surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~. The posterior parameter distributions from these fits ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F-I) were plugged back into our model and showed quantitative agreement with the data ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-E) [@ring_mechanistic_2012; mitra_interleukin-2_2015]. To evaluate the effect of including trafficking, we fit a version of the model without trafficking to the pSTAT5 measurements; the model failed to capture differences with IL-2Rα expression even when using this limited fitting data ([@Fig:supp1]). IL-2·IL-2Rα complexes had a higher affinity for IL-2Rβ and γ~c~ than their IL-15·IL-15Rα counterparts in the trafficking model ($k_{4} < k_{16}$ & $k_{11} < k_{23}$), consistent with prior work ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. However, the opposite was true for IL-2Rβ ($k_{4} > k_{16}$) and the affinities were equal for γ~c~ ($k_{11} = k_{23}$) in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]B). Depletion of surface IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ occurs through rapid endocytosis of active complexes and indeed, depletion occurred faster at higher cytokine doses ([@Fig:modelConstruct]C-D). Correspondingly, active complex internalization ($k_{endo,a}$) was inferred to be ~10x greater than that for inactive species ($k_{endo}$) ([@Fig:modelConstruct]G). These data indicated that accounting for trafficking is essential for modeling IL-2 and IL-15 signaling response.

Our model produced specific predictions about the abundance of each receptor within YT-1 cells ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). To validate these, we experimentally quantified the absolute receptor abundance for YT-1 cells. [TODO: add sentence about how accurate this winds up being].

Since IL-2 and IL-15 lead to formation of analogous active complexes, with IL-2Rβ, γ~c~, and a signaling-deficient high-affinity receptor (IL-2Rα/IL-15Rα), comparing their inferred binding rates gave insight into how IL-2 and IL-15 differ from one another ([@Fig:modelConstruct]F). The two ligands had nearly the same direct binding affinity to IL-2Rβ; however, IL-15 had a higher affinity than IL-2 for its α-chain. Consequently, IL-15’s complexes were inferred to more readily dimerize with a free α-chain than IL-2’s complexes ($k_{8} > k_{20}$, $k_{12} > k_{24}$). Similarly, IL-15 complexes had a slightly higher affinity for capturing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ than their IL-2 counterparts ($k_{9} < k_{21}$, $k_{10} < k_{22}$, $k_{11} < k_{23}$). The affinities of γ~c~ binding to ligand·IL-2Rβ and ligand·α-chain complexes were comparable between IL-2 and IL-15 ($k_{4} = k_{16}$, $k_{5} = k_{17}$). The data is also consistent with literature in that both ligands have higher affinity for IL-2Rβ when they are bound to their α-chain ($k_{2}, k_{14} > k_{11}, k_{23}$) [@spangler_antibodies_2015]. In total, a model of IL-2 and IL-15 incorporating trafficking is consistent with known biophysical and cell response measurements.

## Family model correctly captures both single and combination IL-4/IL-7 dose response

B-C) Fitting model to experimental data. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles.

To further test our model incorporating trafficking, we evaluated its performance in a series of experiments involving IL-4 and IL-7. IL-2 and IL-15 involve the same signaling-competent receptors and so the signaling activity of each cytokine cannot be distinguished. IL-4 and IL-7 activity, in contrast, can be distinguished when both cytokines are co-administered to cells since by measuring STAT6 and STAT5 phosphorylation, respectively [@LEONARD2019832]. Using this phenomenon we explored cross-inhibition data wherein IL-4 and IL-7 doses were administered to human PBMCs both individually and together [@Gonnordeaal1253].

Using surface abundance measurements of IL-4Rα, IL-7Rα, and γ~c~, we applied a steady state assumption in the absence of autocrine ligand to solve for each receptor expression rates. Our model fit both single and dual cytokine dose-response data sets with high accuracy ([@Fig:cytokInt]B-C). The fitting process identifiably constrained reaction rates, trafficking parameters, and pSTAT scaling constants ([@Fig:cytokInt]F-I). Despite fixed initial surface abundance, the receptor expression rates still formed distributions dependent on trafficking parameters ([@Fig:cytokInt]G-H).

The experimental data and model predictions revealed that IL-7 inhibited IL-4 activity more than IL-4 inhibited IL-7 activity ([@Fig:cytokInt]C) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Such inhibitory behavior was explained by the competition of ligand + α-chain complexes for the common γ~c~. The K~d~ of this dimerization process for IL-7 ($k_{27}$) was smaller than the K~d~ for IL-4 ($k_{33}$), indicating that there was tighter dimerization of IL-7·IL-7Rα to γ~c~ than there was dimerization of IL-4·IL-4Rα to γ~c~ ([@Fig:cytokInt]F). The competition for γ~c~ was determined to play a larger role in signaling inhibition than receptor internalization since our model predicted that the same inhibitory relationships hold when active complexes internalize at the same rate as other species ([@Fig:cytokInt]D). Additionally, the majority of γ~c~ remained on the cell surface after ligand stimulation ([@Fig:cytokInt]E), as observed experimentally [@Gonnordeaal1253].

## Tensor Factorization Maps Response-Space of the Gamma Chain Family

One challenge when exploring the function of large receptor families such as the common gamma chain cytokines is their pleiotropy across cell populations. Even with a model that can predict signaling response to a specific concentration of ligand, exploring ligand response across the many responding cell types requires tracking the response of each population individually. Therefore, we sought to apply factorization as a means to visualizing the ligand response across many different cell populations.

To evaluate how different immune cell populations might respond to the gamma chain cytokines, we quantitatively profiled the receptor expression of 11 cell types ([@Fig:tfac]A). Moreover, we applied principal component analysis on these receptor measurements to derive correlations between the cell types and the receptors expressed on their surfaces. T helper cells, including memory and naïve, score the highest positive value along the first component similar to IL-7Rα suggesting a positive correlation ([@Fig:tfac]B-C). Cells similar in profile to NK cells show a large, positive scores value along the second component which match up with IL-2Rβ on the same component; yet these cells have higher negative values on the first component opposing IL-7Rα’s positive loadings value demonstrating an unfavored correspondence ([@Fig:tfac]B-C). Regulatory T cells, including memory and naïve subspecies, show relatively negative values along both components similar to IL-2Rα suggesting stronger correlation than other cells ([@Fig:tfac]B-C).

Upon fitting the model to experimental measurements and obtaining the unknown parameters, we ran simulations on the 11 cell types and monitored their interleukin activity with time. This presented a three-dimensional (time, cell type, ligand) tensor which we then decomposed with non-negative CP decomposition ([@Fig:tfac]D). In the model, we defined cell types by the quantity of each receptor subspecies on their surfaces. In our simulations, each cell was treated with a single interleukin over a range of concentrations ($10^{-4}$ to $100$ nM). This allowed us to build a tensor dataset for the following ligands: wild type IL-2, mutant IL-2, and wild types IL-7 and IL-15. The mutant IL-2 ligand was known to have a 10x enriched affinity for IL-2Rα compared to wild type IL-2 ($10 * k_{1,mut} = k_{1,wt}$). After constructing the tensor with these simulations, we iteratively decomposed it while varying the number of components to determine the minimum number of components needed to obtain a percent explained variance ($\mathrm{R^{2}X}$) above 90%. The $\mathrm{R^{2}X}$ value increased as we increased the number of components and we reached the 90% threshold with three components ($\mathrm{R^{2}X}$ of 93.1%) ([@Fig:tfac]E). To show the relationships among the three dimensions of the tensor, the component values of each dimension were plotted against each other, and the dimensions were placed side by side for interpretation. The tensor’s first dimension was time, second was cell type, and third was ligands.

The decomposition plot for the tensor’s first dimension, time, showed a parabolic relation that increased to a maximum around the 50-minute mark then continued to decrease for all ligands throughout stimulation ([@Fig:tfac]F). For the first decomposition component, the mutant IL-2 scored the highest values across the ligand concentration profile ([@Fig:tfac]I). From the cell decomposition plots and on the same first component, we deduced that the cells that responded to a greater extent to the mutant IL-2 were regulatory and cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, the third decomposition component revealed activity responses almost exclusive to the mutant IL-2 in regulatory T cells. This further lends support for IL-2Rα affinity enriched mutants that demonstrate selective activation for regulatory T cells [@peterson2018long]. Still on the first component, WT IL-2 and IL-15 cytokines elicited relatively strong activation in cytotoxic CD8+ cells, naïve CD8+, memory CD8+, and NK cells. These cells expressed higher IL-2Rβ levels than T helper cells ([@Fig:tfac]A) which differentially tuned their response to IL-2 and IL-15 [@Smitheaan4931]. In component one, IL-2 and IL-15 had relatively similar responses. This stems from the fact that our receptor measurements did not detect IL-15Rα levels, so it required higher doses to achieve a similar activity response. On the second decomposition component, IL-7 was more pronounced ([@Fig:tfac]I). T helper cells, including memory and naïve, had a higher score on the second component, indicating a preferred response to IL-7 ([@Fig:tfac]G); IL-7 activates T helper cells and promotes their survival and maturation [@hassan19987]. Other tensor decomposition methods can also be applied to this tensor. For example, we performed a non-negative Tucker decomposition and showed similar plots in [@Fig:supp4].

## Tensor Factorization Shows Experimental Results

Given that this generated tensor was obtained through running simulations, we showed that the decomposition techniques can also be applied to experimental measurements. We collected ligand activity data for cells treated with either wild type IL-2 or IL-15 in a similar setup and constructed a tensor. Non-negative CP decomposition was performed on this experimental tensor, and similar cell, time, and ligand decomposition plots are shown in [@Fig:expDose].
