## Factorization Explains the Divergent Dose Dichotomy of IL2


![**Non-negative CP decomposition applied to experimenal pSTAT measurements.** A) $R^2X$ using non-negative CP decomposition plotted against the number of components the tensor was decomposed into. B) Timepoint decomposition plot showing component values against time for each factorization component after decomposing the tensor into 2 components. C) Decomposition plot along the cell type dimension showing the 11 cell type values along each component. D) Ligand decomposition plot along third dimension revealing each ligand according to its shape and concentration reflected by its color.](./Figures/figure4.svg){#fig:dualDose}
