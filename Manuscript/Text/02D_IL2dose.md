We evaluated whether our model could predict differences in the cell type-specificity of ligand treatment by comparing its predictions for IL-2/15 responses across our panel of 10 PBMC-derived cell populations. We both measured and used our model to predict PBMC response to cytokine stimulation at 12 unique concentrations ranging from 0.5 pM to 84 nM, and 4 discrete time points; 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours. Overall, our model predictions of ligand pSTAT5 response closely matched experimental measurement ([@Fig:expData; @fig:supp5]). Individual cell types displayed reproducible responses to IL-2/15 treatment ([@Fig:expData]A). The differences between cell types largely matched known differences in cytokine response. For example, T~reg~s were markedly sensitive to IL-2 ([@Fig:expData]B/F), but not IL-15 ([@Fig:expData]B/I), at low concentrations of the cytokine [@Bell_2015; @Peterson_2018]. Small amounts of of IL-2Rα in helper T cells ([@Fig:tfac]A) partially sensitizes them to IL-2 ([@Fig:expData]B; [@Fig:supp5]H). The binding model accurately captured these differences in sensitivity and response across all the cell populations ([@Fig:expData]C).

While the model accurately predicted experimentally-measured responses overall, and specifically the sensitivities of the dose-response profiles, we noticed some discrepancy specifically at high ligand concentrations and longer times in specific cell populations ([@Fig:expData]; [@fig:supp5]). For example, while CD8+ cells almost exactly match model predictions at 1 hr, by 4 hrs we experimentally observed a biphasic response with respect to IL-2 concentration, and a plateau with IL-15 that decreased over time. This decrease in signaling was most pronounced with the CD8+ cells, but could be observed to lesser extents in some other cell populations such as NK cells ([@fig:supp5]). We hypothesize two possible explanations for this discrepancy: First, CD8+ populations are known to proteolytically shed IL-2Rα in an activity-responsive manner [@Junghans1587]. Our model also only uses a very simple sigmoidal relationship between active receptor and pSTAT5 signal. Other components of the Jak-STAT pathway surely influence its dynamic response [@Kuwabara20164334]. However, overall the model presented here remains useful for exploring the determinants of cell type-specific response, which originate at the receptor expression profile on the cell surface.

<!-- TODO: We could discuss the parameters of the sigmoidal fit, because it possibly suggests variation in Jak-STAT properties. -->
