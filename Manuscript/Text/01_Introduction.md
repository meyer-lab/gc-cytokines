abstract: Many receptor families exhibit both pleitropy and redundancy in their regulation, with multiple ligands, receptors, and responding cell populations. The multivariate nature of these systems confounds intuition about therapeutic manipulation. The common γ-chain cytokine receptor dimerizes with complexes of the cytokines interleukin (IL)2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 and their corresponding "private" receptors. These γ-chain cytokines have accrued broad interest as potential immune therapies because they potently modulate immune cell population types. Here, we build a reaction model for the diverse ligand-receptor interactions of common γ-chain cytokines enabling quantitative predictions of response. Using this quantitative model, we employ tensor factorization to build a quantitative map of regulation across the family. These results map the emergent behavior of the common γ-chain cytokines, and demonstrate an approach to generating interpretable guidelines for manipulation of complex receptor families.
