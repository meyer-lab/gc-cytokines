abstract: Many receptor families exhibit both pleitropy and redundancy in their regulation, with multiple ligands, receptors, and responding cell populations. The multivariate nature of these systems confounds intuition about therapeutic manipulation. The common γ-chain cytokine receptor dimerizes with complexes of the cytokines interleukin (IL)2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 and their corresponding "private" receptors. These γ-chain cytokines have accrued broad interest as potential immune therapies because they potently modulate immune cell population types. Here, we build a reaction model for the diverse ligand-receptor interactions of common γ-chain cytokines enabling quantitative predictions of response. Using this quantitative model, we employ tensor factorization to build a quantitative map of regulation across the family. These results map the emergent behavior of the common γ-chain cytokines, and demonstrate an approach to generating interpretable guidelines for manipulation of complex receptor families.

# Introduction

Cytokines are cell signaling proteins responsible for cellular communication within the immune system. The common γ chain ($\gamma_{c}$) cytokine receptors, with interleukins (IL)-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21 as ligands, are integral for modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses and have accrued broad interest for their potential as immune therapies [@Rochman_2009]. γ~c~ ligands bind to private receptors specific to a given cytokine before interacting with the common γ~c~ receptor to induce signaling [@Walsh2010]. Studies showing the γ~c~ family’s involvement in immune system regulation have led researchers to believe that these ligands and receptors can be leveraged in the development of autoimmune, immunodeficient, and cancer therapies [@Pulliam2015]. Presence of the γc receptor has been implicated in spontaneous and induced lymphoproliferation through γ~c~ overexpression and knockout studies, indicating that immune cell populations could be selectively expanded or repressed [@Amorosi3304; @Vigliano2012]. Moreover, γ~c~ receptor mutations have been shown to cause Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) as a defective γ~c~ receptor prevents T and NK cells from maturing properly [@Wang9542].

In cancer immunotherapy, the antitumor effects of γ~c~ cytokines have been explored through clinical trials as these cytokines can show a synergistic increase in the effectiveness of combinatorial drugs.  The γ~c~ cytokines’ ability to regulate lymphocytes can impact both solid and hematological tumors, though there are many drawbacks to their therapeutic use due to the onset of severe side effects such as concomitant over-expansion of certain T cell sub-populations [@Pulliam2015]. Nonetheless, regulation of these cytokines is poorly understood due to the complex binding activation mechanism of their receptors, wherein a single common receptor (γ~c~) must complex with a series of private receptors [@Walsh2010]. Further, any intervention imparts effects across multiple distinct cell populations, with each population having a unique response as a consequence of their broad receptor expression [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Cotarira17].

In addition to therapeutic use of the natural ligands, engineered ligands have been produced with potentially beneficial properties. The most common approach is to develop mutant ligands with altered binding affinities for specific receptors. Mutant IL-2 libraries have been created to see if certain mutant ligands have binding affinities that increase or decrease overall T cell activity [@Berndt1994; @Collins7709]. Researchers addressing immunodeficiency and cancer immunotherapy issues have shown that engineering a mutant IL-2 with a higher binding affinity for one of its receptors, IL-2Rβ, induces greater cytotoxic T cell proliferation (thus improved antitumor responses) and proportionally less regulatory T cell expansion [@Levin2012]. This behavior can be understood considering IL-2’s typical mode of action, for which cells become more sensitive to upon the expression of its higher affinity receptor, IL-2Rα [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. Bypassing the functional requirement of IL-2 for IL-2Rα expression, researchers were able to differentially regulate cells according to their distinctive receptor expressions [@Levin2012]. Other researchers addressing autoimmunity issues have decreased ligand binding affinity by fusing IL-2 to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), which selectively expanded regulatory T cell populations. These IL-2-IgG1 ligands also have a longer half-life and expand fewer NK cells compared to native IL-2 [@Bell_2015; @Peterson_2018].

In light of these observations, current interests in computationally modeling this receptor family have increased, and several studies have revealed insights into predicting its functions and behaviors. Early attempts at mathematically modeling the synergy between IL-2 and IL-4 in B and T cells found quantitative estimates of parameters characterizing proliferative responses to these two cytokines [@BURKE199742]. At the population level, computational models have explained how IL-2 uptake allows regulatory T cells to suppress effector T cell activation. This suppression was shown to rely on cell numbers, surface receptor densities (particularly that of IL-2Rα), available cytokine concentration, and timing [@Feinerman437]. Furthermore, computational models incorporating IL-4, IL-7, and IL-21 have revealed pathway cross-talk due to the hierarchy of affinities for receptor dimerization events involving the common γ~c~ receptor [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Nevertheless, these models lack a major component of intracellular signaling and endosomal trafficking. There is downregulation of IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ when IL-2 is given to cells due to endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes [@ring_mechanistic_2012; @Duprez15091988]. This receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway can be extended to all receptors in the γ~c~ family [@Lamaze_2001]. Models accounting for trafficking have more accurately predicted ligand depletion and T cell proliferation in the case of IL-2 compared to their non-trafficking counterparts, further proving the importance of considering trafficking [@Fallon2000].

In this paper, we assemble a map of γ~c~ cytokine family regulation. We first built a family-wide mathematical model that incorporates both binding and trafficking kinetics. This more comprehensive model allows us to investigate emergent behavior, such as competition between cytokines. This cytokine family is inherently high dimensional—with multiple ligands, cognate receptors, and cells with distinct expression. Using tensor factorization methods, we then mapped the family-wide regulation. This map will prove useful in therapeutic design by showing how native or engineered ligands are addressed to specific immune cell populations based on their receptor expression levels.
