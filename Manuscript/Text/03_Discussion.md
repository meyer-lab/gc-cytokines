<!-- Focus on paper results (need traficking to fit model, differential responsiveness between ligands..).-->

Here, we built a mass-action kinetic binding model for the common γ~c~ receptor family, and used factorization methods to explore its cell type-dependent behavior. This approach provided insights into its high-dimensional regulation. Our binding-reaction model combined the structure of ligand interaction with endosomal trafficking, both of which are critical for accurately modeling response. This model was then able to predict IL-2 and -15 response across a wide panel of PBMC-derived cell types. Mass-action models can help to explain counter-intuitive features of ligand response, and identify specific strategies for optimizing therapeutically-desired properties [@Haugh2004; @MEYER201525]. In the case of the γ~c~ receptor cytokines, a therapeutic goal has been specifically targeting subpopulations of cells based on their unique receptor expression profile [@Levin2012; @BentebibelCD; @Bell_2015; @Peterson_2018]. To visualize these possibilities, we employed tensor factorization to map the signaling response space. This map provided a clearer picture of differential responsiveness between ligands, with selective and increased activation for certain cells and ligands over others. For example, T helper cells showed a preferential response to IL-7, and IL-2Rα affinity enriched mutant IL-2 expressed selective activation for T~reg~s.

The model described herein serves as an effective tool for cell type-selective rational cytokine design. While cell types were defined here by their average receptor expression, cell-to-cell variability within these populations leads to variation in stimuli response [@Cotarira17]. Incorporating single cell variation will provide a more complete picture of population response. In addition to the natural ligands, many cytokine muteins have been designed with altered binding affinities to specific receptors [@Berndt1994; @Collins7709]. Our model serves as a computational tool for screening these muteins as immunotherapeutic drugs that selectively activate certain cell populations over others. For example, IL-2 muteins have shown therapeutic improvement over their wild type counterparts by drastically altering their binding affinities to either preferentially bind to IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~; these muteins were successful in selectively directing regulatory or effector T cell proliferation [@LEON201895]. Models incorporating the full panel of responding cell populations will enable further refinement of these engineered ligands [@Leon_model]. Both IL-2 and IL-15 have extremely short half-lives *in vivo*, in part due to endocytosis mediated clearance [@Konrad2009; @Bernett1595]. Including endocytic trafficking of ligand should enable future work modeling ligand clearance *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Changes in receptor binding may therefore be selected based on both optimized selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties.

<!-- Last paragraph can be general on how we can apply methods discussed here to other families of receptors (PDEs, ...).-->

<!-- TODO: Rewrite from here on. -->

Receptor families with many receptors and ligands are often made up of a dense web of connections, making the role of individual components non-intuitive [@Antebi_BMP; @Eubeleneaat1178]. Interconnected, cross-reactive components may have evolved as a tradeoff between transmitting ligand-mediated information and expanding the repertoire of cell-surface proteins [@KOMOROWSKI201976]. The methods outlined in this paper can be applied to many signaling systems characterized by pleiotropy and high-dimensionality. Notably, these signaling systems can occur extra- or intracellularly [@ANTEBI201716].
