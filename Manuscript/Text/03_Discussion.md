# Discussion

<!-- Focus on paper results (need traficking to fit model, differential responsiveness between ligands..).-->

Here, we built a mass-action kinetic binding model for the common γ~c~ receptor family, and used factorization methods to explore its cell type-dependent behavior. This approach provided insights into its high-dimensional regulation. Our binding-reaction model combined the structure of ligand interaction with endosomal trafficking, both of which are critical for accurately modeling response. This model was then able to predict IL-2 and -15 response across a panel of PBMC-derived cell types. Mass-action models can help to explain counter-intuitive features of ligand response, and identify specific strategies for optimizing therapeutically-desired properties [@Haugh2004; @MEYER201525]. In the case of the γ~c~ receptor cytokines, a therapeutic goal has been specifically targeting subpopulations of cells based on their unique receptor expression profile. To visualize these possibilities, we employed tensor factorization to map the signaling response space. This map provided a clearer picture of differential responsiveness between ligands, with selective and increased activation for certain cells and ligands over others. For example, T helper cells showed a preferential response to IL-7, and IL-2Rα affinity enriched mutant IL-2 expressed selective activation for T~reg~s.

<!-- building on the work here to allude to next part of the project: (cell-cell variability, ligand clearance rate, mutant ligands, ...).-->

The model described herein serves as an effective tool for cell type-selective rational cytokine design. While cell types were defined here by their average receptor expression, cell-to-cell variability within these populations leads to variation in stimuli response [@Cotarira17]. Incorporating single cell variation will provide a more complete picture of population response. In addition to the natural ligands, many cytokine muteins have been designed with altered binding affinities to specific receptors [@Berndt1994; @Collins7709]. Our model serves as a computational tool for screening these muteins as immunotherapeutic drugs that selectively activate certain cell populations over others. For example, IL-2 muteins have shown therapeutic improvement over their wild type counterparts by drastically altering their binding affinities to either preferentially bind to IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~; these muteins were successful in selectively directing regulatory or effector T cell proliferation [@LEON201895]. Given the increasing interest in designing IL-2 muteins, previous mathematical models accounting for IL-2 dynamics in Helper, Regulatory, and Memory T cell populations were used to explore treatment efficacies for potentiating immunity or tolerance [@Leon_model]. Both IL-2 and IL-15 have extremely short half-lives *in vivo*, in part due to endocytosis mediated clearance [@Konrad2009; @Bernett1595]. Including endocytic trafficking of ligand should enable future work modeling ligand clearance *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Changes in receptor binding may therefore be selected based on both optimized selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties.

<!-- Last paragraph can be general on how we can apply methods discussed here to other families of receptors (PDEs, ...).-->

Receptor families with many receptors and ligands are often made up of a dense web of connections, making the role of individual components non-intuitive [@Antebi_BMP; @Eubeleneaat1178]. Interconnected, cross-reactive components may have evolved as a tradeoff between transmitting ligand-mediated information and expanding the repertoire of cell-surface proteins [@KOMOROWSKI201976]. The methods outlined in this paper can be applied to many signaling systems characterized by pleiotropy and high-dimensionality. Within a biological context, these signaling systems can occur extra- or intracellularly [@ANTEBI201716]. The EGFR family serves as a prime candidate for applying these methods since EGFRs are targeted in cancer therapies due to their increased expression in tumor cells [@CIARDIELLO20031348]. Spatial complexity can also be incorporated into similar models of noisy signaling through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEs have identified spatio-temporal specificities of the Hedgehog pathway; such methods can be paired with methods similar to ours to study how concentration gradients of muteins alter cell responses [@Li543]. Nonetheless, our model has revealed critical design specifications for the common γ~c~ family that can also be applied to many other receptor families.
