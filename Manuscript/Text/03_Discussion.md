# Discussion

<!-- Focus on paper results (need traficking to fit model, differential responsiveness between ligands..).-->

Here, we built a mass-action kinetic binding model for the common γ~c~ receptor family, and used factorization methods to explore its cell type-dependent behavior. This approach provided insights into its high-dimensional regulation. Our binding-reaction model combined the structure of ligand interaction with endosomal trafficking, both of which are critical for accurately modeling response ([@Fig:supp1; @Fig:modelConstruct]). This model was then able to predict IL-2 and -15 response across a panel of PBMC-derived cell types. Mass-action models can help to explain counter-intuitive features of ligand response, and identify specific strategies for optimizing therapeutically-desired properties [@Haugh2004; @MEYER201525]. In the case of the γ~c~ receptor cytokines, a therapeutic goal has been specifically targeting subpopulations of cells based on their unique receptor expression profile. To visualize these possibilities, we employed tensor factorization to map the signaling response space ([@Fig:tfac]). This map provided a clearer picture of differential responsiveness between ligands, with selective and increased activation for certain cells and ligands over others. For example, T helper cells showed a preferential response to IL-7, and IL-2Rα affinity enriched mutant IL-2 expressed selective activation for T~reg~s.

The model described herein serves as an effective tool for cell type-selective rational cytokine design. While cell types were defined here by their average receptor expression, cell-to-cell variability within these populations leads to variation in stimuli response [@Cotarira17]. Incorporating single cell variation will provide a more complete picture of population response. Furthermore, in addition to the natural ligands, many cytokine muteins have been designed with altered binding affinities to specific receptors [@Berndt1994; @Collins7709]. Consequently, our model serves as a computational tool for screening immunotherapeutic drugs with the goal of selectively activating or deactivating certain cells over others. For example, IL-2 muteins have shown therapeutic improvement over their wild type counterparts by drastically altering their binding affinities to either preferentially bind to IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~; these mutants were successful in selectively directing regulatory or effector T cell proliferation [@LEON201895]. Given the increasing interest in designing IL-2 mutants, previous mathematical models accounting for IL-2 dynamics in Helper, Regulatory, and Memory T cell populations were used to explore treatment efficacies for potentiating immunity or tolerance [@Leon_model]. Both IL-2 and IL-15 have extremely short half-lives *in vivo*, in part due to endocytosis mediated clearance [@Konrad2009; @Bernett1595]. Including endocytic trafficking of ligand should enable future work modeling ligand clearance *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Changes in receptor binding may therefore be selected based on both optimized selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties.

<!-- Last paragraph can be general on how we can apply methods discussed here to other families of receptors (PDEs, ...).-->

Receptor families with many receptors and ligands are often made up of a dense web of connections, making the role of individual components non-intuitive [@Antebi_BMP; @Eubeleneaat1178]. Interconnected, cross-reactive components may have evolved to as a tradeoff between transmitting ligand-mediated information and expanding the repretior of cell-surface proteins [@KOMOROWSKI201976]. Moreover, this pleiotropic signaling can occur intracellularly [@ANTEBI201716]. The methods outlined in this paper can be applied to many receptor families characterized by pleiotropy and high-dimensionality. An example of such families could include EGFRs as they are being targeted in cancer therapies due to their increased expression in tumor cells [@CIARDIELLO20031348]. Even with the common γ~c~ receptor family intricacy, spatial complexity can also be captured through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and incorporated into our model or any systems model with noisy signaling. For example, PDEs have been applied to identify spatio-temporal specificities of the Hedgehog pathway; such models can be used to study and design morphogens to alter their effect on forming concentration gradient that alter cell responses [@Li543]. Nonetheless, our model has revealed critical design specifications for the common γ~c~ family that can also be applied to many other receptor families.
