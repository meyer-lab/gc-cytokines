<!-- Focus on paper results (need traficking to fit model, differential responsiveness between ligands..).-->

Pleiotropic receptor families often have components with non-intuitive roles in signaling cascades, necessitating thorough experimentation in order to identify molecular targets [@Antebi_BMP; @Eubeleneaat1178]. Such families evolved to have many interconnected, cross-reactive components that individually produce noisy signals [@KOMOROWSKI201976]. Moreover, this pleiotropic signaling can occur intracellularly [@ANTEBI201716]. In this paper, we explored a mass-action kinetic binding model for the common γ~c~ receptor family that provided insights into its high-dimensional regulation across numerous cell populations. While previous modeling efforts ignored endosomal trafficking, our model reveals it essential for capturing the divergent IL-2 and IL-15 dose responses in cells with different IL-2Rα expression ([@Fig:supp1]). Understanding and incorporating receptor trafficking is crucial given that it has been previously shown in other ligand families to convolute the correlation between binding affinities and cell stimulation levels for the human growth hormone (hGH) [@Haugh2004]. In light of recent interests in deconvolving the pleiotropic complexity of the γ~c~ family, we employed the model to map the signaling landscape of the γ~c~ cytokines through tensor factorization. We ran simulations for ligand activation responses in different cell populations, defined in the model by their measured receptor profiles ([@Fig:tfac]A), and over a broad range of concentrations for several cytokines and mutants ([@Fig:tfac]F-I). The map revealed differential responsiveness between ligands, with selective and increased activation for certain cells and ligands over others. For example, T helper cells showed a preferential response to IL-7, and IL-2Rα affinity enriched mutant IL-2 expressed selective activation for regulatory T cells. Finally, to validate the robustness of the model, we ran model simulations with conditions similar to our experimental designs to ensure that our model could predict experimental measurements that it had not been previously trained upon.

<!-- building on the work here to allude to next part of the project: (cell-cell variability, ligand clearance rate, mutant ligands, ...).-->

The model described herein serves as an effective tool for drug screening and design across a wide array of cell types. While our simulations were simplified in the sense of using one receptor expression profile for each cell type, cell-to-cell variability within these established populations has been regarded critical for understanding the variation in cell sensitivities to the many stimuli [@Cotarira17]. Therefore, our model has the flexibility to include such experimentally measured variation in receptor abundance on many cell populations to deduce a larger map for the plasticity of the common γ~c~ signaling. Furthermore, common γ~c~ muteins have been designed by altering their binding affinities to their cognate receptors [@Berndt1994; @Collins7709]. Consequently, our model serves as a computational tool for screening immunotherapeutic drugs with the goal of selectively activating or deactivating certain cells over others. For example, previous IL-2 mutants have shown therapeutic improvement over their wild type counterparts by drastically altering their binding affinities to either preferentially bind to IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~; these mutants were successful in selectively tuning regulatory T cell proliferation [@LEON201895]. Given the increasing interest in designing IL-2 mutants, previous mathematical models accounting for IL-2 dynamics in Helper, Regulatory, and Memory T cell populations were used to explore treatment efficacies for potentiating immunity or tolerance [@Leon_model]. Our model can improve upon the design of these mutants and therapies because it yields insight into the performance of many non-binary muteins in terms of moderately inhibiting or expanding T cell populations instead of drastically doing so. Furthermore, our model examines temporal dose responses and allows for analyzing ligand survival and degradation through tracking all ligand and receptor components during each simulation. Understanding ligand clearance in terms of our factorization map provides further insights for selective cell signaling and regulation. 

<!-- Last paragraph can be general on how we can apply methods discussed here to other families of receptors (PDEs, ...).-->

The methods outlined in this paper can be applied to many receptor families characterized by pleiotropy and high-dimensionality. An example of such families could include EGFRs as they are being targeted in cancer therapies due to their increased expression in tumor cells [@CIARDIELLO20031348]. Even with the common γ~c~ receptor family intricacy, spatial complexity can also be captured through Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and incorporated into our model or any systems model with noisy signaling. For example, PDEs have been applied to identify spatio-temporal specificities of the Hedgehog pathway; such models can be used to study and design morphogens to alter their effect on forming concentration gradient that alter cell responses [@Li543]. Nonetheless, our model has revealed critical design specifications for the common γ~c~ family that can also be applied to many other receptor families.
