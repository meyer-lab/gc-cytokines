# Discussion

- Many receptor families are composed of multiple ligands, receptors, and cell populations
	- Components of pleiotropic receptor families often have non-intuitive roles in signaling cascades, necessitating thorough experimentation in order to identify molecular targets [@Antebi_BMP; @Eubeleneaat1178].
    - Pleiotropic signaling can also occur intracellularly [@ANTEBI201716]
    - Methods can be applied to identify spatio-temporal specificity of signaling (first need to build a PDE model to represent said behavior before decomposition) [@Li543].
    - hGH affinities do not correlate well with cell stimulation levels because of endosomal trafficking. [@Haugh2004]
    - EGFRs are being targeted in cancer therapies due to their increased expression in tumor cells. [@CIARDIELLO20031348]
    - large receptor families evolve to have many interconnected, crossreactive components that individually produce noisy signals [@KOMOROWSKI201976]
