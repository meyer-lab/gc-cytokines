Using the model, we sought to identify strategies for selectively targeting T~reg~s. In order to quantify the effectiveness of selectively activating T~reg~s, we defined a specificity metric as the normalized pSTAT5 response of T~reg~s divided by the pSTAT5 response of T-helper or NK cells. As expected, both model prediction and experimental values of this specificity increased with lower concentrations of IL-2 and had a lesser concentration-dependent relationship with IL-15 ([@Fig:mutFac]A/B). With this quantity, we then examined the sensitivity of the specificity metric with respect to both surface and endosomal binding. Increasing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ unbinding (k5rev), particularly in the endosome, provided the largest and most consistent benefit to specificity ([@Fig:mutFac]C). Changes in endosomal binding rates have been shown to have important effects on protein therapy's half-life and potency [@Sarkar05082002]. To the extent this binding can be separately manipulated, the model indicates it might help to improve specificity as well. Moreover, the model predicts that ligands with reduced IL-2Rα affinity had a greatly decreased ability to specifically activate T~reg~s with respect to NK cells regardless of their IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity ([@Fig:mutFac]D). These ligands were also shown to have a slightly decreased ability to specifically activate T~reg~s with respect to T-helper cells. Therefore, reducing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity can help modulate the potency of these cytokines, but maintaining IL-2Rα affinity is still critical. In total, these results demonstrate this model's ability to predict immune cell response to wild-type or engineered cytokines, particularly for engineering cell-specific responses.

To evaluate the potential of the model for cytokine engineering, we measured PBMC response to several Fc-fused IL-2 monomers. Several wild-type and mutant forms of IL-2 were produced as fusions with a monomeric human antibody Fc domain. Targeted mutations were introduced to IL-2 domains known to be instrumental to either IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ binding. Cytokines are often Fc-conjugated to increase the drug's *in vivo* half-life, and can be conjugated in a variety of orientations. We quantified the effect of our engineered mutations and Fc conjugation on IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ binding kinetics using bio-layer inferometry ([@Fig:supp6]). Surprisingly, we found that Fc-conjugation to the N-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity, while conjugation to the C-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rα affinity (tbl. SD1, [@Fig:mutFac]E). Therefore, Fc conjugation can have either complementary or counterproductive effects on mutation-mediated changes in receptor affinity, and affinity must be assessed in the clinical format. The oberved changes in receptor-ligand kinetics caused by Fc-fusion was assessed for ligands fused using a 20 amino acid linker; fusion using linkers of different lengths may also alter the effects that this mutation has on cytokine binding kinetics.

Using these altered affinities, we were able to accurately predict cell type-specific activity response to our modified ligands ([@Fig:supp7]; [@Fig:mutFac]F-H). While the model widely captured cell type specific response to the muteins, accuracy did vary according to ligand and cell type, and was noticabely reduced for NK cells, and in predicting response to N88D N-Term. Ligands with decreased IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity had decreased T~reg~ or T-Helper activity response, respectively, as expected. As before, visualizing the effect of altered binding kinetics on cellular response is complicated by the contribution of cell type, concentration, and time ([@Fig:tfac]E-I). In order to visualize our results, we performed tensor factorization using the experimentally-determined pSTAT5 response of PBMCs exposed to both wild-type and modified IL-2 ligands ([@Fig:mutFac]I-L). Two components explained 80% of the variance in the new combined data tensor. Among the ligands, wild-type N-terminally conjugated IL-2 was the most potent inducer of T~reg~ response as shown by its strong component 2 weighting ([@Fig:mutFac]I/J). The difference in signaling with Fc conjugation orientation is likely due to these conjugation types' opposing effects on the cytokine's IL-2Rα affinity.
