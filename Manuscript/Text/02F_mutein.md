Using the model, we sought to identify strategies for selectively targeting T~reg~s. In order to quantify the effectiveness of selectively activating T~reg~s, we defined a specificity metric as the pSTAT5 response of T~reg~s divided by the pSTAT5 response of T-helper or NK cells. As expected, both model prediction and experimental values of this specificity increased with lower concentrations of IL-2, and had a lesser concentration-dependent relationship with IL-15 ([@fig:mutFac]A/B). With this quantity, we then examined the sensitivity of the specificity metric with respect to both surface and endosomal binding. Decreasing IL-2Rα unbinding (k5rev), particularly in the endosome, provided the largest and most consistent benefit to specificity ([@fig:mutFac]C). Changes in endosomal binding rates have been shown to have important effects on protein therapy's half-life and potency [@Sarkar05082002]. To the extent this binding can be separately manipulated, the model indicates it might help to improve specificity as well. Moreover, the model predicts that ligands with reduced IL-2Rα affinity had a decreased ability to specifically activate T~reg~s with respect to NK and T-Helper cells regardless of their IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity ([@fig:mutFac]D). Therefore, while reducing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity can help modulate the potency of these cytokines, maintaining IL-2Rα affinity may be especially critical. In total, these results demonstrate this model's ability to dynamically predict immune cell response to engineered cytokines, particularly for engineering cell-specific responses.

To evaluate the potential of the model for cytokine engineering, we measured PBMC response to several Fc-bound IL-2 monomers. Muteins were created by introducing targeted point mutations to IL-2 domains known to be instrumental to either IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ binding. Cytokines are often Fc-conjugated to increase the drug's *in vivo* half-life, and can be conjugated in a variety of orientations. We quantified the effect of our engineered mutations and Fc conjugation on IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ binding kinetics using bio-layer inferometry ([@fig:supp6]). Surprisingly, we found that Fc-conjugation to the N-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity, while conjugation to the C-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rα affinity (tbl. SD1, [@fig:mutFac]E). Therefore, Fc conjugation can have either complementary or contradictory effects on mutation-mediated changes in receptor affinity, and affinity must be assessed in the clinical format.

Using these altered affinities, we were able to accurately predict cell type-specific activation and the EC~50~ of response to these modified ligands ([@fig:supp7], [@fig:mutFac]F). Ligands with decreased IL-2Rα or IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity had increased T~reg~ or T-Helper EC~50~s, respectively, as expected. As before, visualizing the effect of altered binding kinetics on cellular response is complicated by the contribution of cell type, concentration, and time ([@Fig:tfac]). In order to visualize our results, we performed tensor factorization using the experimentally-determined pSTAT5 response of PBMCs exposed to both modified IL-2 ligands ([@Fig:mutFac]G-J). Two components explained roughly 80% of the variance in the new combined data tensor. Among the ligands, wild-type N-terminally conjugated IL-2 were most correlated to T~reg~s via their shared correlation with component 2 ([@Fig:mutFac]H). The difference in signaling with Fc conjugation orientation is likely due to these conjugation types' opposing effects on the cytokine's IL-2Rα affinity.
