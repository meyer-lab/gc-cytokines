In order to further evaluate our model, we experimentally measured PBMC response to several IL-2 muteins and Fc-bound IL-2 monomers. Muteins were created by introducing targeted point mutations to IL-2 domains known to be instrumental in determining the binding affinity of the cytokine to both IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ (insert paper(s) here). Another way in which cytokine binding affinities can be modified is by conjugation of another domain to the cytokine. In clinical applications, cytokines are often conjugated to antibodies in order to increase the longevity of cytokine-based drugs in the body. Conjugating these antibodies to the N or C-terminus of the cytokine has differing effects on the cytokine's binding affinities. We quantified the effect of these mutations and conjugations on IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ receptor binding affinities, and found that conjugation of Fc domains to the N-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity, while conjugation to the C-terminus selectively lowered IL-2Rα affinity ([@fig:mutFac]A). Using these altered affinities, we were able to accurately predict cell-type specific activation levels when PBMC cells were exposed to these modified ligands ([@fig:supp6]).

It is desirable for many clinical applications for a drug to induce a purely immunosuppresive response. In order to quantify the effectiveness of these modified and wild-type cytokines in selectively activating immunosuppressive T~reg~ cells, we defined formulated specificity functions. These functions were defined as pSTAT5 activity of T~reg~s divided by pSTAT5 activity of T-helper cells or NK cells. Specificty of T~reg~ activation with respect to NK and T-helper cells was experimentally determined and predicted by our model to be largest at low concentrations of IL-2, but was not found to have a significant relationship with IL-15 concentration ([@fig:mutFac]B/C). Because high T~reg~ specificity is desirable for several clinical applications of cytokine-based drugs, we also quantified the partial derivatives of our specificity functions with respect to both surface and endosomal binding constants, and found that increasing IL-2Rα affinity while decreasing IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity on the cells surface would most drastically increase the cytokine's T~reg~ activation specificity ([@fig:mutFac]D). These effects were notably different between surface and endosomal binding rates. Furthermore, our model predicts that ligands with reduced IL-2Rα affinity had a decreased ability to specifically activate T~reg~s with respect to NK and T-Helper cells over any degree of IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinity reduction ([@fig:mutFac]E). (put something specifically about current industry drug-discovery/design here?) Our model was also able to accurately guage the effect that changes in ligand-receptor binding affinities had on their respective EC~50~s ([@fig:mutFac]F). Ligands with decreased IL-2Rα affinity had increased EC~50~s for T~reg~ varieties, and ligands with decreased IL-2Rβ/γ~c~ affinities had larger EC~50~s for T-Helper cells, in accordance with our previous findings.

In order to better visualize the experimental results when PBMCs were exposed to our muteins and modified IL-2 ligands, we performed tensor factorization on a tensor containing both wild-type and modified IL-2 ligands experimental results ([@Fig:mutFac]G-J). Using a tensor factorization with two components explained roughly 80% of the variance in the new combined data tensor. Among the ligands, wild-type IL-2/15 and wilde-type IL-2 conjugated to an Fc domain at it's N-terminus are most correlated to T~reg~s via their shared correlation with component 2 ([@Fig:mutFac]G-J). This suggests that cytokines conjugated to domains at their N-terminus are more strongly suited to induce selective T~reg~ activation than those conjugated at their C-terminus, which is likely due to these conjugation types' opposing effects on the cytokine's IL-2Rα affinity.
