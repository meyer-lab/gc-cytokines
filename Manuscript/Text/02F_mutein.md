## Model Accurately Captures Cell Type-Specific Response to IL-2 Muteins

![**Model predicts and decodes cell-type specific response to IL-2 muteins.** A) CD25 and CD122/132 dissociation constants for panel including wild-type IL-2 and IL-2 muteins. B-C) Predicted and measured Treg activation specificity compared to NK (B) and T helper (C) cells. D) Partial derivatives of Tregs activation specificity compared to NK and T helper cells with respect to various surface and endosomal reverse binding rate constants. E) Treg activation specificity with respect to NK and T helper cells as a function of CD122/132 binding affinity for ligands with wild type and reduced CD25 affinity. Specificity values are shown for cells exposed to a cytokine concentration of 0.038 nM. F) Experimentally measured and model-predicted EC~50~s of dose response across IL-2 muteins and all 10 cell types. EC~50~s are shown for 1 hr time point. G-J) Tensor factorization of experimentally measured cellular activation values for wild-type IL-2/15, and IL-2 muteins. Component values versus ligand (G), cell type (H), time (I), and cytokine concentration (J). ](./Figures/figure6.svg){#fig:mutFac}
