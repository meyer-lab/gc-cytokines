## Model Accurately Captures Cell Type-Specific Response to IL-2 Muteins

![**Model predicts and decodes cell-type specific response to IL-2 muteins.** A) CD25 and CD122/132 dissociation constants for panel of wild-type and mutant IL-2 molecules. B-C) Predicted and measured Treg activation specificity compared to NK (B) and T helper (C) cells. D) Function of Treg’s activation specificity with respect to NK and T helper cells’ partial derivatives with respect to surface and endosomal binding rate constants. E) Treg specificity with respect to NK and T helper cells as a function of CD122/132 binding affinity for ligands with wild type and reduced CD25 affinity. Specificity values are shown for cytokine concentrations of -1.415 log10[nM]. F) Both experimentally-derived and model-predicted EC50s of dose response across mutant IL-2 variants and all 10 cell types. EC50s are shown for 1 hr time point. G-J) Tensor factorization of model-predicted cellular activation values for mutant IL-2 variants. Component values versus ligand (G), cell type (H), time (I), and cytokine concentration (J). ](./Figures/figure6.svg){#fig:mutFig}
