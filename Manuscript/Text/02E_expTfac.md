Given that tensor factorization helped to visualize model predictions of IL-2, -7, and -15 response, we wished to evaluate whether it could similarly help to visualize experimental measurements. We structured our experimental pSTAT5 measurements in an identical format to the model simulation tensor [@Fig:tfac]. Factoring into two components explained roughly 90% of the variance in the original data ([@Fig:expFac]A), which we can then interpret using each of the factor plots ([@Fig:expFac]B–D).

Interestingly, these factors are distinguished by their concentration dependence more so than being tied to a specific ligand ([@Fig:expFac]D). Component 2 increases with low concentrations of IL-2, while component 1 only increases at high concentrations of either ligand. As expected, effector and regulatory T cells are most strongly associated with components 1 and 2, respectively, matching their known dose-response profiles ([@Fig:expData]). However, component 2 is also distinct from 1 in its sustained activation ([@Fig:expFac]B; Fig. S5). This can be expected from rapid endocytosis-mediated downregulation of IL-2Rβ at high IL-2/-15 concentrations ([@Fig:modelConstruct]). Thus, tensor factorization helps to separate these differences in dose- and cell type-specific responses. Furthermore, there was clear correspondence between the model and experimental factorization. For example, the low-dose IL-2-specific component in the model and experiment factorization correlated strongly in their cell type weighting (cosine similarity of 0.96; [@Fig:tfac]H; [@Fig:expFac]C).
