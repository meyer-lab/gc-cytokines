## Tensor Factorization of Experimental Measurements Distinguishes Low- & High-Concentration IL-2/15 Responses

Given that tensor factorization helped to visualize model predictions of IL-2, -7, and -15 response, we wished to evaluate whether it could similarly help to visualize experimental measurements. We collected our experimental pSTAT5 measurements in an identical format to the model simulation tensor [@Fig:tfac]. Factoring into two components explained roughly 90% of the variance in the original data ([@fig:expFac]A), which we can then interpret using each of the factor plots ([@fig:expFac]B–D).

Interestingly, these factors are distinguished by their concentration-dependence more so than being tied to a specific ligand ([@fig:expFac]D). Component 2 only increases with low concentrations of IL-2, while component 1 increases at high concentrations of either ligand. As expected, effector and regulatory T cells are most strongly associated with components 1 and 2, respectively, matching their known dose-response profiles (CITE) (TODO: Ref data). However, component 2 is also distinct from 1 in its sustained activation ([@fig:expFac]B & TODO: Ref data). This can be expected from rapid endocytosis-mediated downregulation of IL-2Rβ at high IL-2/15 concentrations ([@Fig:modelConstruct]). Thus, tensor factorization helps to separate these differences in dose- and cell type-specific responses, as well as how they interact.
