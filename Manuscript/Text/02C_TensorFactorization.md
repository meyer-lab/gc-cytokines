Even with an accurate model, exploring a dynamic ligand response across the many responding cell types and ligand treatments remains challenging. Restricting ones view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of a bigger picture. Therefore, we sought to apply factorization as a means to visualize the ligand response.

As response to ligand is largely defined by receptor expression, we quantitatively profiled the abundance of each IL-2, IL-15, and IL-7 receptor across eleven PBMC subpopulations ([@Fig:tfac]A). These data recapitulated known variation in these receptors, including high IL-7Rα or IL-2Rα expression in helper and regulatory T cells, respectively (CITE). We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on these receptor measurements to help visualize variation in these data ([@Fig:tfac]B-C). Principal component 1 largely separated cells along their IL-7Rα expression, with IL-7Rα itself on positive loading, and T helper cells scoring most positively. Interestingly, IL-7Rα-positive cells had correspondingly lower levels of γ~c~ and IL-2Rβ. IL-7 was uniquely able to cross-inhibit other γ~c~ cytokines, and excess IL-7Rα likely helps to ensure this occurs (([@Fig:cytokInt]). The second principal component most prominently separated NK cells from other types due to their uniquely high expression of IL-2Rβ. (TODO: Maybe something about CD8+ vs Treg?)

To build a compendium of model predictions, we assembled simulation predictions across cell types, ligand conditions, and time. This three-dimensional (time, cell type, ligand) tensor was then decomposed with non-negative CP decomposition ([@Fig:tfac]D). We selected three components during decomposition as this number captured 95% of the variance in our original data tensor ([@Fig:tfac]E). To show the relationships among the tensor's three dimensions, the component plots of each dimension are plotted alongside each other.

CP decomposition can be interpreted by matching a single component's effects across the different dimensions. For example, component 1 is greatest at roughly 50 mins, for CD8+ cells, and at high concentrations of IL-2 ([@Fig:tfac]F–I). This indicates that this variation in the data occurs with high concentrations of IL-2, leads to a response in CD8+ T cells, and peaks at 50 minutes. In this way, different contributory factors in cell response are separated.

All three components showed similar variation with time, peaking quickly and then decreasing after roughly 50 mins ([@Fig:tfac]F). This can be understood through two phases, in which receptor activation occurs, and then trafficking-mediated downregulation of the receptors ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Comparing the cells and ligands decomposition plots showed expected effects. IL-7 response was separated as component 2, showed a dose-dependent increase, and correlated with IL-7Rα expression levels ([@Fig:tfac]H–I). Interestingly, IL-2/IL-15 response separated along concentration, rather than ligand. Low concentrations of IL-2 were represented by component 3, and equally activated both regulatory and effector T cells ([@Fig:tfac]H–I). High concentrations of IL-2/IL-15 were represented by component 1 and activated effector T cells over regulatory ones ([@Fig:tfac]G/I). This known dichotomy occurs through increased IL-2Rα expression in Tregs ([@Fig:tfac]A). Importantly, PCA of receptor abundance itself does not allow one to observe a ligand concentration-dependent difference in response ([@Fig:tfac]B). Therefore, this demonstrates the benefit of tensor-based factorization. Interestingly, our factorization showed that Tregs can be more accurately descriminated by their combined IL-7 and IL-2 response ([@Fig:tfac]H). Efforts to selectively expand these cells could take advantage of this observation with combination ligand treatments (CITE).

Other tensor decomposition methods exist and can also be applied to visualize model-predicted response. For example, non-negative Tucker decomposition relaxes CP methods by employing a core tensor enabling interaction terms between components ([@Fig:supp4]) (CITE). However, the core tensor makes it difficult to interpret the output.
