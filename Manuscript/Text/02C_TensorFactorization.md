## Tensor Factorization Maps the Gamma Chain Family Response Space

![**Tensor factorization to map model-predicted cytokine responses.** A) Measured receptor abundance for ten PBMC-derived subpopulations.

The variation explained by each component is the product of the component's time, ligand, and cell type factorization.

Even with an accurate model, exploring dynamic responses across the many responding cell types and ligand treatments remains challenging. Restricting ones' view to a single time point, cell type, or ligand concentration provides only a slice of the picture. Therefore, we sought to apply factorization as a means to globally visualize ligand response.

As response to ligand is largely defined by receptor expression, we quantitatively profiled the abundance of each IL-2, IL-15, and IL-7 receptor across ten PBMC subpopulations ([@Fig:tfac]A). These data recapitulated known variation in these receptors, including high IL-7Rα or IL-2Rα expression in helper and regulatory T cells, respectively [@hassan19987; @Rochman_2009]. As mentioned above, IL-7 is uniquely able to cross-inhibit other γ~c~ cytokines, and excess IL-7Rα likely helps to ensure this occurs ([@Fig:cytokInt]) [@Gonnordeaal1253]. Principal component analysis (PCA) helped visualize variation in these data ([@Fig:tfac]B-C). Principal component 1 most prominently separated the NK cells from all others due to their distinct receptor expression, with high levels of IL-2Rβ and relatively lower levels of γ~c~. Principal component 2 then separated effector and regulatory T cell populations, based on their high IL-7Rα or IL-2Rα abundance, respectively. However, PCA also helped to identify slightly higher γ~c~ levels in T~reg~s, and the slightly more T~reg~-like profile of memory CD8+ cells.

To build a tensor of model predictions, we assembled simulation predictions across cell types, ligand conditions, and time. This three-dimensional (time, cell type, ligand) tensor was then decomposed with non-negative canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition ([@Fig:tfac]D). We selected three components during decomposition as this number captured 95% of the variance in our original data tensor ([@Fig:tfac]E). To show the relationships among the tensor's three dimensions, the component plots of each dimension were plotted alongside each other.

CP decomposition can be interpreted by matching a single component's effects across factor plots for each dimension. For example, component 2 is greatest at roughly 50 mins, for helper and CD8+ T cells, and almost exclusively with IL-7 stimulation ([@Fig:tfac]F–I). This indicates that this variation in the data occurs with IL-7 stimulation, leads to a response in helper and CD8+ T cells, and peaks at 50 minutes. In this way, different contributory factors in cell response are separated.

Components 2 and 3 showed similar variation with time, peaking quickly and then decreasing after roughly 50 mins ([@Fig:tfac]F). This can be understood through two phases, in which receptor activation occurs, and then trafficking-mediated downregulation of the receptors ([@Fig:modelConstruct]). Comparing the cells and ligands decomposition plots showed expected effects. IL-7 response was separated as component 2, showed a dose-dependent increase, and correlated with IL-7Rα expression levels ([@Fig:tfac]H–I). Interestingly, IL-2/IL-15 response separated by concentration, rather than ligand. Low concentrations of IL-2 were represented by component 1, and equally activated both regulatory and effector T cells ([@Fig:tfac]H–I). High concentrations of IL-2/IL-15 were represented by component 3 and activated effector T cells over regulatory ones ([@Fig:tfac]G, I). This known dichotomy occurs through higher IL-2Rα expression in T~reg~s ([@Fig:tfac]A). The factorization also shows that the model predicts low-dose IL-2 stimulation to drive more sustained signaling than that from a high dose ([@Fig:tfac]F/I). Importantly, while PCA can help to distinguish cells based on distinct receptor expression profiles, cells separated differently based on their predicted ligand stimulation response ([@Fig:tfac]B/G/H). This demonstrates the benefit of tensor- and model-based factorization. Factorization highlighted a final possibility that T~reg~s might be further discriminated by their combined IL-7 and IL-2 response ([@Fig:tfac]H). Efforts to selectively expand these cells could test this observation with combination ligand treatments.

Other tensor decomposition methods exist and can also be applied to visualize model-predicted response. For example, non-negative Tucker decomposition relaxes CP methods by employing a core tensor enabling interaction terms between components ([@Fig:supp4]) [@Tucker1966]. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of interpretability, as visualizing the core tensor's effect is challenging. In total, factorization methods provide an effective means of visualizing the high-dimensional regulation of complex receptor families, including the influence of time, ligand stimulation, and receptor expression.
