# Methods

All analysis was implemented in Python, and can be found at [https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding](https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding), release 1.0 (doi: [00.0000/arc0000000](https://doi.org/doi-url)).

## Immune complex binding measurement

IC binding to hFcγRs was analyzed using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing hFcγRs as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Receptor expression was quantified using antibodies against each hFcγR and flow cytometry measurement as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Briefly, ICs were generated by coincubation of 10 µg/ml anti-TNP hIgG and 5 µg/ml TNP-coupled BSA for 3 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. ICs were incubated with 100,000 CHO cells stably expressing hFcγRs for 1 h under gentle shaking at 4℃. Bound ICs were detected by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab')~2~ fragment at 0.5 mg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Each IC binding measurement was normalized to the average of all the points within that replicate. Receptor expression was quantified in terms of absolute number through comparison to fluorescence standards (QSC microspheres, Bangs Labs). Data were analyzed with Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo) or FACSDiva Software.

## FcγR abundance measurement

TODO: Have Markus look this over and edit.
TODO: Needs to include how immune populations were purified and defined, sources for antibodies and spheres.

FcγR abundance was measured from peripheral blood leukocytes of C57Bl/6J mice under steady state conditions.

Surface receptor was quantitated by measuring antibody binding capacity (ABC). Calculation of ABC on cells is based on a reference curve for the correlation between fluorescence intensity (caused by the respective anti-FcγR antibody) and the number of antibody binding sites. This reference curve is generated using a group of micropheres with known ABC values, reflecting their ability to bind a known amount of antibody. In each experiment these microspheres are stained with the respective anti-FcγR antibody in the same concentration as it is used for staining of the cells.   

## *In vivo* regression

Regression against *in vivo* effectiveness of mIgG treatments was performed by least-squares (`scipy.optimize.least_squares`). Association constants for all combinations of mIgG and mFcγR were obtained from previous experimental measurements [@Gavin20; @Robinette:2015tp]. Each effectiveness was presented as the percent reduction in the number of lung metastases quantified [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu]. To account for the limited range of this quantity (e.g. one cannot have a reduction of 200%), the regression was transformed by tanh such that:

$$ y = tanh (X \cdot p) $$ {#eq:lsq}

so that $\lim_{x\to\infty} y(x) = 1$. $X$ is the predicted mFcγR activity for each cell line according to our model, and $p$ is the regression weights.

### PCA of mIgG-mFcγR affinities

Principle component analysis was performed using `scikit-learn` and the affinities of the four mIgGs (mIgG1, mIgG2a, mIgG2b, mIgG3), with or without knockout treatments, for each of four receptors (mFcγRI, mFcγRIIB, mFcγRIII, mFcγRIV). Association constants for all combinations of mIgG and mFcγR were obtained from previous experimental measurements [@Bruhns:2009kg]. The affinity for a knocked-out or blocked mFcγR was assumed to be zero. The affinities were not normalized before PCA transformation.
