## Constructing a Family-Wide Model of the Common Gamma Chain Cytokine Receptors


![**A family-wide model of the common gamma chain cytokine receptors.** A) XXX. B) XXX. C) XXX. D) XXX. E) XXX.](./Figures/figure1.svg){#fig:modelConstruct}

To begin to map the relationship between cytokine interaction and activation of the common gamma chain cytokine family, we assembled a reaction model for the family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Each cytokine binds to one or two private receptors, along with the common gamma chain receptor. As gamma chain binding is has universally been observed to be weaker than binding to the private recptor members, we assumed binding to a private receptor occurs prior to gamma chain interaction. IL2 and IL15, both cytokines with two private receptors, share the private receptor IL2Rb, but also bind to private, signaling-incompetent receptors IL2Ra and IL15Ra, respectively. To correlate binding state and activation of the receptors, we assumed receptor-ligand complexes that harbor gamma chain complexed to a signaling-competent private receptor are active.

To parameterize the remaining unknown parameters of our model, we fit our model to previous measurements of IL2- and IL15-induced STAT5 activation and IL2Rb internalization [@ring_mechanistic_2012]  (FIGURE CITE).
