![**A family-wide model of the common gamma chain cytokine receptors.** A) Cartoon of all receptor-ligand complexes and binding events. Ligands are circles and complexes are boxes. Active species are denoted by red boxes. Rate constants obtained from literature are denoted by diamonds; those solved through detailed balance are denoted by octagons and those solved through fitting are denoted by octagons with double outline. 
B-C) Model prediction vs. experimental results for maximal pSTAT5 activation in IL2Ra+/- YT-1 cells under various concentrations of ligand stimulation for 500 minutes. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles and the 95% confidence intervals of model predictions are denoted by shaded regions.
D-G) Model prediction vs. experimental results for percent of initial IL2Rb on the cell surface for various ligand stimulation concentrations and cell types. Measurements were collected over the course of 90 minutes. Experimental measurements are denoted by triangles and the 95% confidence intervals of model predictions are denoted by shaded regions.
H) Posterior distributions for IL2's and IL15's analogous reaction rates. Values have units of 1/min and are scaled by log10 for plotting purposes. 
I-J) Posterior distribution for trafficking rate parameters and receptor expression rates. Trafficking rates have units of 1/min and receptor expression rates have units of number / cell * minute; both are scaled by log10 for plotting purposes.](./Figures/figure1.svg){#fig:modelConstruct}

To begin to map the relationship between cytokine interaction and activation of the common gamma chain cytokine family, we assembled a reaction model for the family ([@Fig:modelConstruct]A). Each cytokine binds to one or two private receptors, along with the common gamma chain receptor. As gamma chain binding is has universally been observed to be weaker than binding to the private recptor members, we assumed binding to a private receptor occurs prior to gamma chain interaction. IL2 and IL15, both cytokines with two private receptors, share the private receptor IL2Rb, but also bind to private, signaling-incompetent receptors IL2Ra and IL15Ra, respectively. To correlate binding state and activation of the receptors, we assumed receptor-ligand complexes that harbor gamma chain complexed to a signaling-competent private receptor are active.

To parameterize the remaining unknown parameters of our model, we fit our model to previous measurements of IL2- and IL15-induced STAT5 activation and IL2Rb internalization [@ring_mechanistic_2012]  (FIGURE CITE).
