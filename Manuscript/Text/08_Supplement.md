![**A no-trafficking model is fit to IL-2 and IL-15 data.** A) Reaction model without trafficking fit to IL-2 and IL-15 pSTAT5 dose response data [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. This model was not fit to the surface IL-2Rβ measurements since no receptors were allowed to internalize from the cell surface ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D).
B) Posterior distributions of analogous reverse reaction rates for IL-2 and IL-15 in no-trafficking model.
C) Posterior distributions for receptor expression rates in no-trafficking model. Units are $\mathrm{\frac{number}{cell * minute}}$ and the y-axis is scaled by log~10~ for plotting purposes.
D) Posterior distribution for the pSTAT5 activity scaling constant in no-trafficking model. ](./Figures/figureS1.svg){#fig:supp1}

![**Geweke criterion scores for trafficking and no-trafficking IL-2 and IL-15 models.** Geweke criterion in all subplots was calculated using first 10% of MCMC chain and last 50% of MCMC chain. A-D) Scores from parameters sampled in the trafficking model ([@Fig:modelConstruct]). E-G) Scores from parameters sampled in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]). ](./Figures/figureS2.svg){#fig:supp2}

![**Tucker factorization of immune cell type responses.** A) Timepoint decomposition plot showing component values against time for each factorization component after decomposing the tensor’s first dimension into 3 components. B,E) Decomposition plot along the second (cell) dimension after decomposing it to 4 components showing the eight cell type values along each component.  C,F) Ligand decomposition plot along the third dimension after decomposing it to 4 components revealing each ligand according to its shape and concentration reflected by its color. ](./Figures/figureS4.svg){#fig:supp4}
