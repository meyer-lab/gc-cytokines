![**Model without trafficking fails to capture IL-2/IL-15 dose response.** A) Model without trafficking fit to IL-2 and IL-15 pSTAT5 dose response data [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. This model was not fit to the surface IL-2Rβ measurements since no receptors were allowed to internalize from the cell surface ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D).
B) Posterior distributions of analogous reverse reaction rates for IL-2 and IL-15 in no-trafficking model.
C) Posterior distributions for receptor surface abundance in no-trafficking model.
D) Posterior distribution for the pSTAT5 activity scaling constant in no-trafficking model. ](./Manuscript/Figures/figureS1.svg){#fig:supp1}

![**Geweke criterion scores for trafficking and no-trafficking IL-2 and IL-15 models.** Geweke criterion in all subplots was calculated using first 10% and last 50% of MCMC chain. A-D) Scores from parameters sampled in the trafficking model ([@Fig:modelConstruct]). E-G) Scores from parameters sampled in the no-trafficking model ([@Fig:supp1]). ](./Manuscript/Figures/figureS2.svg){#fig:supp2}

![**Receptor quantification and gating of PBMC-derived immune cell types.** A) Preliminary gating for singlet lyphocytes. B) Example staining for CD122 (red), the corresponding isotype control (blue), and unstained cells (black). C) Gating for live T helper and T regulatory cells during receptor quantifation. D) Live cell NK cell gating. E) Live cell CD8+ T cell gating. F) Gating for fixed T helper and T regulatory cells during pSTAT5 quantification. G) Fixed CD8+ T cell and NK cell gating.](./Manuscript/gatingFigure.svg){#fig:gating}

![**Tucker factorization of predicted immune cell type responses.** A) Timepoint decomposition plot showing component values against time for each factorization component after decomposing the tensor’s first dimension into 3 components. B, C) Decomposition plot along the second (cell) dimension after decomposing it to 3 components showing the 11 cell type values along each component. D) Core tucker heatmap unfolded along its third dimension. E) Ligand decomposition plot along the tensor’s third dimension after decomposing it to 4 components revealing each ligand according to its shape and component number reflected by its color. ](./Manuscript/Figures/figureS4.svg){#fig:supp4}
