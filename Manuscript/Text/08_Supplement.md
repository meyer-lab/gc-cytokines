![**A no-trafficking model is fit to IL-2 and IL-15 data.** A) Reaction model without trafficking fit to IL-2 and IL-15 pSTAT5 dose response data [@ring_mechanistic_2012]. This model was not fit to the surface IL-2RÎ² measurements since no receptors were allowed to internalize from the cell surface ([@Fig:modelConstruct]B-D).
B) Posterior distributions of analogous reverse reaction rates for IL-2 and IL-15 in no-trafficking model.
C) Posterior distributions for receptor expression rates in no-trafficking model. Units are $\mathrm{\frac{number}{cell * minute}}$ and the y-axis is scaled by log~10~ for plotting purposes.
D) Posterior distribution for the pSTAT5 activity scaling constant in no-trafficking model. ](./Figures/figureS1.svg){#fig:supp1}
