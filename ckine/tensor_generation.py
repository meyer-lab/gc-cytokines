"""
Generate a tensor for the different y-values that arise at different timepoints during the model and with various initial conditions. The initial conditions vary the concentrations of the ligands and the expression rates of the receptors to simulate different cell lines.
Important Notes:
    y_of_combos is a multidimensional matrix of size (length mesh x 1000 timeponts x 56 values of y)
    values is also a multidimensional matrix of size (length mesh x 1000 x 16 values for cytokine activity, surface receptors amount, and total receptors amount)
